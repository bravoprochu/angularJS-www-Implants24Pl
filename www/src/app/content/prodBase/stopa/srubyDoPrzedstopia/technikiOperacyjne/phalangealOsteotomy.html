        <p>It may be necessary to complete the metatarsal correction by means of a phalangeal osteotomy
(known as an Akin osteotomy).<br>
Phalangeal osteotomy is considered appropriate for 3 types of corrections :</p>
<ul><li>shortening in cases of gigantism of the hallux necessitating a bicortical reduction osteotomy
or a shortening osteotomy,</li>
<li>correction of an interphalangeal valgus with a varisation osteotomy,</li>
<li>correction of pronation with a derotation osteotomy.</li><ul>
<p>This osteotomy permits correction in 3 planes of the space and brings about correction by
shortening, varisation and derotation.</p>

<p>The osteotomy is performed with an oscillating saw. The principle is to perform the distal
osteotomy parallel to the root of the nail (1st line) and the proximal osteotomy parallel to
the base of the 1st phalanx (2nd line). A triangle or parallelepiped-shaped resection is then
performed correcting the interphalangeal valgus.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">FIXATION</md-subheader>
<p>Fixation of the osteotomy is then performed simply by the oblique
insertion of a self-compressing screw (generally using the larger sizes
from L26 to L30), which makes it possible to obtain:</p>
<ul><li>excellent primary stability due to the quality of bony purchase distally;
a consequence of:<br>
- sufficiently large screw diameter,<br>
- appropriate distal thread size in cancellous bone (equivalent to the
cancellous thread of the AO small fragment screw).<br></li>
<li>excellent inter-fragmentary compression due to the differential thread.
It is important to perform anterograde insertion of compression screws
using the following technique:</li>
<li>First clear a small extra-articular area of the phalangeal edge. The point of entry for the
drill is situated over the base of the 1st metatarsal on its projecting medial plantar edge,</li>
<li>The drill is aimed towards the lateral condyle of the 1st phalanx and is thus directed:<br>
- forward (distally),<br>
- upward (dorsally),<br>
- laterally.</li><ul>

<p>It is important to ensure that the phalangeal correction is adequate and stable before closure
by means of a simulated weight bearing test.</p>
