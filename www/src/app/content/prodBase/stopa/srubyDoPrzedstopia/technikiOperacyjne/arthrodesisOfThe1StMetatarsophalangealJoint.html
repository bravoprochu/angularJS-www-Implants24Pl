 <md-subheader class="md-primary">CLOSURE</md-subheader>
        <p>The surgeon closes in his usual manner. It is absolutely necessary, however, to close the capsular
plane with an absorbable suture before closing the superficial planes.</p>
<p>According to surgeon preference the tourniquet can be released to attain haemostasis
before closure. Drain and suture the subcutaneous plane then using either continuous or
interrupted sutures close the skin. Nonabsorbable stitches are removed after 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">POSTOPERATIVE PRECAUTIONS</md-subheader>
<p>It is particularly important to avoid the normal push-off phase of gait for 45 days and the patient
should wear a postoperative shoe as a precautionary measure. At the end of this period the
arthrodesis can be considered as consolidated.</p>

<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(0)"></image-big>
<p>The main indications for arthrodesis are advanced degenerative joint disease
(Hallux Rigidus), major static disorders, certain cases of Hallux Valgus, certain cases
of revision surgery for Hallux Valgus or special cases where the first ray must play
a role in maintaining forefoot stability.</p>
The advantages of the suggested hardware include:
<ul><li>>Excellent primary stability due to the quality of cancellous bony purchase: a
consequence of appropriate thread size distally (equivalent to the thread of the AO small
fragment screw), and appropriate diameter of the screws (large enough),</li>
<li>Excellent interfragmentary compression due to the differential thread.
One screw may be all that is required.</li></ul>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">ARTICULAR APPROACH</md-subheader>
 <p>The skin incision is centered over the joint on the medial side of the foot. The joint should be
initially debrided so that the bony cuts can be performed.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">PREPARATION FOR ARTHRODESIS</md-subheader>
<p><strong>Articular excision</strong></p>
<p>Using an oscillating saw the osteotomies are made flat and should be as thin as possible
to conserve bone stock.<bt>
They should realign the toe and give a slight extension to the great toe (about
15° in men and 20° in women, unless there are special circumstances).<br>
The automatic shortening of the great toe may help with the subsequent
gait pattern. The bone surfaces are then opposed and maintained in this position during
drilling.<br>
The entry point for the drill is situated at the neck of the 1st metatarsal on its projecting
medial plantar edge (at the level of the neck and behind the head).<br>
The drill is aimed at the lateral condyle of the 1st P. It is directed laterally,superiorly and
distally following the axis of the phalanx.</p>
<p><strong>Articular reshaping</strong></p>
<p>To make apposition easier, to improve bone contact and to avoid excessive shortening, the
articular surfaces can be shaped using fine nibblers (Gouge forceps) or a burr. This allows
the creation of a convex metatarsal bone surface and a matching concave phalangeal
surface. The principles of resurfacing and fixation remain the same.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">FIXATION</md-subheader>
 <p>Use the gauge for measuring and direct reading of the implant size.</p>
<p>The arthrodesis screw may be inserted manually or by using power.
Because of the powerful self-compression produced by the device,
it is important to maintain a stable position of the bone segments
when inserting the screw, using either forceps or a temporary pin,
so that the construct is as solid as possible.</p>
<p>Once the screw is in position satisfactory primary stability is
guaranteed. However if there is any concern regarding the need for
better control of rotation, then it is advisable to add a second self
compressing screw of smaller diameter, a pin, or a staple according
to the surgeon's preference.</p>
