 <md-subheader class="md-primary">CLOSURE</md-subheader>
        <p>The surgeon closes in his usual manner. It is absolutely necessary, however, to close the capsular
plane with an absorbable suture before closing the superficial planes.</p>
<p>According to surgeon preference the tourniquet can be released to attain haemostasis
before closure. Drain and suture the subcutaneous plane then using either continuous or
interrupted sutures close the skin. Nonabsorbable stitches are removed after 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">POSTOPERATIVE PRECAUTIONS</md-subheader>
<p>It is particularly important to avoid the normal push-off phase of gait for 45 days and the patient
should wear a postoperative shoe as a precautionary measure. At the end of this period the
arthrodesis can be considered as consolidated.</p>

<p>The main indications for arthrodesis are advanced degenerative joint disease
(Hallux Rigidus), major static disorders, certain cases of Hallux Valgus, certain cases
of revision surgery for Hallux Valgus or special cases where the first ray must play
a role in maintaining forefoot stability.</p>
The advantages of the suggested hardware include:
<ul><li>>Excellent primary stability due to the quality of cancellous bony purchase: a
consequence of appropriate thread size distally (equivalent to the thread of the AO small
fragment screw), and appropriate diameter of the screws (large enough),</li>
<li>Excellent interfragmentary compression due to the differential thread.
One screw may be all that is required.</li></ul>
