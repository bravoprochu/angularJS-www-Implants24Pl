        <p>This is the most familiar technique used in France as it allows translation of the 1st MT head
while permitting rotation and shortening. It is the gold standard and is ideal for
moderate Hallux Valgus in women aged over 50 years. The fixation obtained is
generally extremely stable.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">MEDIAL INCISION AND SOFT TISSUE RELEASE</md-subheader>
<p>The usual incision is straight or omega-shaped and made at the junction of the
plantar and dorsal skin. A medial capsular approach and lateral arthrolysis are
possible through a single incision.</p>
<p>The joint can be sufficiently well released to mobilise the distal segment without
compromising blood supply to the head.</p>
<p>The aim is to release and mobilise the mal positioned sesamoids. This approach
permits section of the metatarsosesamoid ligament and release of the direct and
oblique tendons of the adductor hallucis.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">EXOSTOSECTOMY</md-subheader>
 <p>The term exostosectomy is inappropriate as this is really an irregularity rather than a true bony
exostosis. The medial surface of the 1st MT head is, however, irregular. Irregularities should
be smoothed using an oscillating saw or nibblers (Gouge forceps).</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">METATARSAL OSTEOTOMY</md-subheader>
<p>Use an oscillating saw. The principle is to isolate the metatarsal head now angulated towards
the body from the baguette-shaped diaphyseal plantar segment. The lines can be variously
oriented according to surgeon preference. The osteotomies should allow lateralisation of the
distal segment so that head and sesamoids are repositioned.</p>
<p>The fact that the plane of the cut runs obliquely in the frontal plane and parallel to the
inferior surface of the metatarsal enables the 1st MT head to be lowered in order to
restore weight bearing to the first ray.</p>
<p>The main cut, which runs obliquely outward, downward and backward, begins 2 mm
under the first MT neck and ends 2 mm above the plantar cortical bone at the metaphyseal
junction of the 1st MT. It can be made shorter or longer according to surgeon
preference or to the reduction desired.</p>
<p>Secondary resections can be used to obtain shortening or rotation.</p>
<p>It is often necessary to resect the proximal, lateral corner of the translated metatarsal
fragment in order to avoid contact with the medial cortical bone of the 2nd MT, which may
prevent the desired reduction.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">FIXATION</md-subheader>
<p>Once the correction has been obtained the bone fragments are
stabilised using the special clamp.
Using the special drill, distal drilling is performed either vertically,
which brings about bicortical purchase, or angled towards the
metatarsal head to ensure a good grip in cancellous bone.
The lengths required are read directly from the gauge.</p>
<p><strong>The length of the self-compressing screw is selected in accordance with one of the
following options:</strong></p>
<ul><li>For cortical bone purchase the length is taken exactly as read or one size up e.g. (13 mm
reading => 14 mm screw).</li>
<li>For cancellous bone the screw length should be shorter to avoid the screw penetrating
the joint.</li></ul>
<p>The screw is supplied sterile. It is positioned manually by holding it using the grip. The
surgeon should not touch the implant itself.<br>
The separation of implant and gripping device will occur early and more or less so according
to bone quality. The surgeon then uses the screwdriver to complete the positioning of the
screw. It is important to ensure that the hex head of the screwdriver is properly engaged
with the screw to avoid any damage to the screw head.<br>
The second screw is inserted in position using the same technique aiming for bicortical
purchase.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">ASSOCIATED ACTS</md-subheader>
<p>It is usually necessary to resect the projecting bony edge of the upper
part of the metatarsal. The bone fragment thus released can be
repositioned on the lateral edge of the metatarsal.</p>
<p>Release of the abductor tendon of the great toe can be performed at this
stage or later during closure.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">VERIFICATIONS AND TESTING</md-subheader>
<p>The corrections must be stable before capsular closure. It is important to ensure the quality
of the reduction and the stability of the proceedure at this stage by simulating weight
bearing. If the cartilaginous surface is properly positioned and tension imbalance corrected,
it is reasonable to expect a satisfactory long term result.</p>

<section>
 <md-subheader class="md-primary">CLOSURE</md-subheader>
<p>The surgeon closes in his usual manner. However it is essential that the capsular plane be
sutured (absorbable sutures suffice in our experience) prior to closure of the superficial
planes.</p>
<p>According to surgeon preference, the tourniquet can be released to attain haemostasis prior
to closure. Drain and suture the subcutaneous plane then using either continuous or
interrupted sutures close the skin. Nonabsorbable stitches are removed after 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</md-subheader>
<ul><li>Usually there is no need to replace the dressing. If applied carefully, taking
correction of the deformities into account, the dressing from the operating
theatre can be left in place for about fifteen days.</li>
<li>It is advisable to administer prophylactic anticoagulation.</li>
<li>It is advisable for the patient to wear a special postoperative shoe for a period
of between a fortnight to a month.</li>
