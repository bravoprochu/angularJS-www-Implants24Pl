    <p>This is a distal osteotomy with the appearance of a chevron when viewed from the side. The
position of the osteotomy and the “shortness” of the horizontal cutting line mean that it offers
more potential for correction than the scarf whether this involves:</p>
<ul><li>translation,</li>
<li>shortening,</li>
<li>or rotation.</li></ul>
<p>Epiphyseal bone bone is of better quality and this reduces the risks of impaction of
the bone fragments after osteotomy, helping to reduce the "tile effect" and the risk
of metatarsus elevatus.</p>
<p>Fixation in contrast is more difficult and
requires meticulous attention to technique.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">MEDIAL INCISION AND SOFT TISSUE RELEASE</md-subheader>
<p>It is often possible to make slightly shorter incisions than for the scarf (about 5 cm) because of
the reduced length of the horizontal bone cut. The incision can be the conventional straight one
or omega-shaped curved superiorly over the bunion. This trick may avoid painful scarring in
the case of revision surgery (in particular when subsequent removal of the fixation device is
envisaged).</p>
<p>The joint is freed sufficiently to allow mobilization of the distal segment without compromising
blood supply to the head.</p>
<p>The aim is to release and mobilise the mal positioned sesamoids. This approach enables
section of the metatarsosesamoid ligament and release of the direct and oblique tendons of
the adductor hallucis.</p>
<p>At this stage it is possible to perform a phalangeal osteotomy without actual fixation which
limits tension during the reduction manoeuvres. This is especially useful with severe
deformities.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">EXOSTOSECTOMY</md-subheader>
<p>The medial surface of the first MT head is irregular. This should be smoothed using an oscillating
saw or nibblers (Gouge forceps). The term exostosectomy is inappropriate as this is
really an irregularity rather than a true bony exostosis.</p>
<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(5)"></image-big>
<p>The dorsal osteotomy is very distal and should be sloped slightly
forward and downward. The saw line should remain parallel to the
articular surface of the first MT. The horizontal osteotomy is short
but should finish proximal to the perforating vessels.</p>
<p>A second dorsal osteotomy can then be made with the same slope as the first, but
perpendicular to the axis of the foot (Axis of the 2nd MT). A shortening component can
be added if desired.</p>
<p>A triangle or parallelepiped rectangle of bone is produced if shortening is obtained by
this resection.</p>
<p>It is then possible to recentre the head by lateralising it. Correction of DM2AA occurs
and weight bearing to the first ray is restored, the extent of which is determined by the
obliquity of the bony cuts.</p>
<p>Please note. Shortening and derotation may reduce the amount of lateralisation needed
below that anticipated by pre-operative planning.</p>
<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(6)"></image-big>
<p>Fixation may be less stable than for a scarf osteotomy because it is more
difficult to insert two screws.</p>
<p>It may be worth beginning to stabilise the correction with a Rocher pin.
The pin is positioned vertically 3 mm behind the dorsal osteotomy and
along the medial edge of the metatarsal. It may be removed at a later
date or left in place.<p>
<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(7)"></image-big>
<p>Definitive stable fixation can be obtained by means of a snap-off selfcompressing
screw directed distally into the head.</p>
<p>Drilling is performed using the chevron drill bit. The entry point is selected
behind and lateral to the pin. The length is measured and the selfcompressing
screw inserted.</p>
<p>It is advisable to select a size smaller than that measured in order to
avoid the screw penetrating the joint.The joint must be examined directly
for any intra-articular protrusion of the screw or pin, if they are
intended to remain in position.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">ASSOCIATED ACTS</md-subheader>
<p>The residual bony prominence on the medial side of the metatarsal should
be resected. This fragment may be positioned on the lateral side of the
metaphysis.</p>
<p>Release of the abductor tendon of the great toe can be useful.This allows
the tendon to be repositioned along the medial surface of the metatarsal
when closing.</p>

        <p>The correction must be stable before capsular closure. It is important to ensure the quality
of the reduction and the stability of the proceedure at this stage by simulating weight
bearing. If the cartilaginous surfaces are properly repositioned and tension imbalance
corrected, it is reasonable to expect a satisfactory long term result.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">CLOSURE</md-subheader>
<p>The surgeon closes in his usual manner. However it is essential that the capsular plane be
sutured (absorbable sutures suffice in our experience) prior to closure of the superficial
planes.<br>
According to surgeon preference, the tourniquet can be released to attain haemostasis prior
to closure. Drain and suture the subcutaneous plane then using either continuous or
interrupted sutures close the skin. Nonabsorbable stitches are removed after 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</md-subheader>    
 <ul><li>Usually there is no need to replace the dressing. If applied carefully, taking
correction of the deformities into account, the dressing from the operating
theatre can be left in place for about fifteen days.</li>
<li>It is advisable to administer prophylactic anticoagulation.</li>
<li>>It is advisable for the patient to wear a special postoperative shoe for a period
of between a fortnight to a month.</li></ul>
