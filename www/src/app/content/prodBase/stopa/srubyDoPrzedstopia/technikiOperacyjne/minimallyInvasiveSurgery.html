        <p>Minimally invasive treatment for Hallux Valgus should meet the same criteria as open
surgery and should allow one:</p>
<ul><li>1. to realign the first phalanx on the M1 head,</li>
<li>2. to reduce DMAA angle,</li>
<li>3. to reduce the medial prominence of the head,</li>
<li>4. to release the lateral portion of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the 1st ray and to
release its adductor,</li>
<li>5. to incorporate a varus osteotomy of the base of P1.</li></ul>
<p>The standard technique does not include fixation of metatarsal and phalangeal osteotomies,
which are held in the corrected position by the post-operative dressing in the first week, by
an orthosis (spacer) in the following two or three weeks.</p>
<p>This technique cannot be performed without specific instrumentation.</p>
<p>This surgery is only indicated for a primary congenital deformity without arthrosis, where
the 1st metatarso-phalangeal articulation is congruent (pathological DMAA angle > 7°) and
the varus metatarsal angle is less than or equal to 16°.</p>
