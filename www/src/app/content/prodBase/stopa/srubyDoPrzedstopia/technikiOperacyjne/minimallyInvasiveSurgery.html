        <md-subheader class="md-primary">MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY</md-subheader>
        <p>Minimally invasive treatment for Hallux Valgus should meet the same criteria as open
surgery and should allow one:</p>
<ul><li>1. to realign the first phalanx on the M1 head,</li>
<li>2. to reduce DMAA angle,</li>
<li>3. to reduce the medial prominence of the head,</li>
<li>4. to release the lateral portion of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the 1st ray and to
release its adductor,</li>
<li>5. to incorporate a varus osteotomy of the base of P1.</li></ul>
<p>The standard technique does not include fixation of metatarsal and phalangeal osteotomies,
which are held in the corrected position by the post-operative dressing in the first week, by
an orthosis (spacer) in the following two or three weeks.</p>
<p>This technique cannot be performed without specific instrumentation.</p>
<p>This surgery is only indicated for a primary congenital deformity without arthrosis, where
the 1st metatarso-phalangeal articulation is congruent (pathological DMAA angle > 7°) and
the varus metatarsal angle is less than or equal to 16°.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">PATIENT POSITIONING</md-subheader>
<p>Because an image intensifier must be used to monitor osseous procedures
and adjust osteotomies, the patient needs to be positioned as
follows:</p>
<ul><li>in the strict dorsal decubitus position,</li>
<li>with the operated foot extending beyond the edge of the table,</li>
<li>with the opposite foot on a support with the knee bent.</li></ul>
<p>The fluoroscope is positioned at the side of the operated foot.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">1ST STEP: <br>REDUCTION OF THE MEDIAL PROMINENCE OF THE HEAD AND THE REVERDIN-ISHAM OSTEOTOMY</md-subheader>
<p>Using a Beaver surgical knife <strong>(handle for Beaver surgical knife - ref. 254 327 /
Beaver blade - ref. 248 435)</strong>, make an incision antero medial to the M1 head
directed towards the medial eminence.</p>
<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(16)"></image-big>
<p>Using a “windshield wiper” action in contact with the bone creates a working space, which
can be expanded by using an elevator <strong>(Elevator - ref. 253 937)</strong>.</p>
<p>Wedge burr is placed into contact with the bone and makes it possible to shave, step
by step, the medial part of the head. The burr is selected according to bone quality
and the extent of the desired metatarsal correction.<strong>
(Wedge burr 3.1 x 13 mm - ref. 256 016 or Wedge burr 4.1 x 13 mm - ref. 256 017)</strong>.</p>
<p>The burrs must be used with great care bearing in mind one golden rule: the rotation rate
should be kept as low as possible, between 1,500 and 8,000 rotations/minute maximum (use
of a torque reducer is highly recommended). An unduly high rotation rate may burn the soft
tissues and damage the bone.</p>
<p>Resection stops at the base of the functional articular surface. This must be strictly
monitored by both palpation and radiography.</p>
<p>At the end the bone debris is removed by manual pressure and by using the specially
adapted rasps. <strong>(Rasp width 1.5 mm - ref. 253 279, rasp width 3 mm - ref. 253 280)</strong>.</p>
<p>The Wedge burr is replaced by a straight osteotomy burr <strong>(Shannon Recta burr 2.0 x 12 mm -
ref. 256 018 or Shannon Larga burr 2.0 x 12 mm - ref. 256 020 - if greater corrective angulation
is necessary)</strong> positioned via the same incision to contact the side of the bone at 45° angulation,
with the tip of the burr at the top of the joint, slopping towards the back of the sesamoids.</p>
<p>The REVERDIN-ISHAM osteotomy is performed parallel to the joint surface in the frontal
plane and at 45° in the sagittal plane, from dorsal distal to plantar proximal. It
is incomplete, leaving a lateral hinge, correcting the DMAA and effecting a slight derotation
(or “varisation” to be more precise) of the head.<br>
It is held in place manually by bringing P1 into adduction and slight plantar flexion.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">2ND STEP: LATERAL RELEASE</md-subheader>
<p>Through a 2nd incision made dorsolaterally to the metatarso-phalangeal joint and just to the
side of the extensor tendon, a Beaver blade <strong>(Handle for Beaver surgical knife - ref. 254 327 /
Beaver blade - ref. 248 435)</strong> is introduced initially parallel to the lateral side of the joint. This
is medially rotated thin 90° to enter the joint at mid-height. Cutting laterally releases the
capsule and tenotomises the adductor of the 1st ray, permitting straightforward realignment
of P1 onto the M1 head.</p>
<p>Fluoroscopy can be used to ensure that correction is complete by mobilising the toe into varus.
The lateral sesamoid must remain under M1 head.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">3RD STEP: THE AKIN PHALANGEAL OSTEOTOMY</md-subheader>
<p>Using a third approach, made dorsomedially to the proximal third of the P1 metaphysis
and parallel to the bone, the Beaver blade <strong>(Handle for Beaver surgical knife -
ref. 254 327 / Beaver blade - ref. 248 435)</strong> enters just medial to the extensor tendon running
along the bone. It is replaced by the raspatory <strong>(Raspatory - ref. 248 437)</strong> which
makes it possible to pass under the periosteum. During this step it is important to monitor
the position of the instruments using fluoroscopy.</p>
<p>The straight osteotomy burr <strong>(Shannon Recta burr 2.0 x 12 mm - ref. 256 018)</strong> replaces
the rasp <strong>(Rasp - ref. 248 437)</strong>, to perform the osteotomy at the base of P1.
It is held in place by the fingers while monitoring, if possible, the absence of any springiness
in the hinge.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">CLOSURE</md-subheader>
<p>Each incision is closed, using either an absorbable or non-absorbable suture. The dressing
is applied in a figure eight to hold the osteotomies in place. It remains for 8 days.</p>

<section>
<md-subheader class="md-primary">POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</md-subheader>
<p>In vast majority of cases, surgery can be performed on an out-patient basis:</p>
<ul><li>with the patient returning home the same day,</li>
<li>with a surgical shoe with a stiff sole which is worn for 1 to 3 weeks.</li></ul>
<p>Full weight-bearing is allowed from the start, but it is important to organise rest periods
with the foot elevated.</p>
<p>The patient is seen again on day 8:</p>
<ul><li>the dressing is removed,</li>
<li>non-absorbable sutures can be removed</li>
<li>a silicon orthotic spacer is made by the surgeon or podiatrist. This is worn for a maximum
of 2 weeks. Radiographic follow-up is then performed with the spacer in position. The patient
leaves with a transverse metatarsal arch, which is supported by a cohesive elastic bandage.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The patient re-attends after one month for a second radiographic and clinical assessment,
this time performed under loading and without the spacer ; the post-operative shoe having
been replaced two weeks earlier by a flexible sports type shoe.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The patient attends again between three to four months for final radiographic and clinical
assessment. The timing of later follow-up varies, but is generally performed annually.</li></ul>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">OPTIONAL ASSOCIATED PROCEEDURES</md-subheader>
<p>Additional proceedures on the lateral rays of the foot and/or lesser toes can be performed
using similar techniques, such as:</p>
<ul><li>2, 3 or even 4 recession osteotomies of the metatarsal heads:<br>
EQUIPMENT:<br> - handle for Beaver surgical knife <strong>- ref. 254 327</strong> / Beaver blade - <strong>ref. 248 435</strong><br>
- Shannon Recta burr 2.0 x 12 mm - <strong>ref. 256 018</strong><br>
- elevator - <strong>ref. 253 937</strong></li>
<li>Multiple tenotomies and capsulotomies of the lesser toes:<br>
