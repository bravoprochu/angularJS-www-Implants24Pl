        <p>The arthrodesis version of the Calcanail is used in the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recent comminuted fractures where internal fixation is impossible or destined to fail because of the seriousness of the cartilage injuries (mixed fractures with 2 or more fracture lines; comminuted fractures)</li>
            <li>Calcaneal fracture sequelae in cases with post-traumatic osteoarthritis and/or poor functional results</li>
            <li>Degeneration of the posterior subtalar joint or valgus flatfoot deformities.</li>
        </ul>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Patient positioning</md-subheader>
        <p>Two positions are possible: side-lying or prone.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The patient is usually placed on his/her side with the flexed limb resting on a pad and the foot off the table. Lateral and retrotibial fluoroscopy views are taken by externally rotating the foot and tipping the C-arm along the table axis.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, the patient can be placed prone with the knee flexed so the leg is placed at 45° relative to the table, particularly if it is a bilateral fracture.</li>
        </ul>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary"><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>Placement of K-wire in posterior tuberosity</md-subheader>
        <p>At the junction between the posterior and plantar aspect of the heel, use a scalpel to perform a posterior incision down to the bone. The incision starts from the lowest part of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity and goes up in a posterior direction
            for 20mm.</p>
        <p>The Ø12 K-wire with stopper <strong>(Ref. 265 571)</strong> must be placed in the correct position as this determines the orientation of the work chamber and later on, the nail position <strong>(fig. 1a, 1b and1c)</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the lateral view, the K-wire should be positioned in the direction of the lower portion of the posterior talar articular surface.</li>
            <li>On the retrotibial view, K-wire placement must take into account the subtalar angle; this roughly corresponds to the axis of the first interdigital space
            </li>
        </ul>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary"><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>Placement of subtalar distractor</md-subheader>
        <p>The second surgical step consists of placing a Caspar-type subtalar distractor
            <strong>(Ref. 265 599)</strong> onto two K-wires, one in the talus and one in the posterior calcaneal tuberosity. If needed, these Ø3.2 K-wires <strong>(Ref. 265 668)</strong> are used with the distractor to correct the varus deformity of
            the posterior tuberosity and distract the subtalar joint so the depressed articular surface can be reduced. Conversely, they can be used with the compressor (Ref. 266 353) to remove the joint space and bring the freshened talar and calcaneal
            articular surfaces together.
            <br> Two 3.2 mm K-wires <strong>(Ref. 265 668)</strong> will be placed across the foot axis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the calcaneal K-wire in the posterosuperior part of the posterior tuberosity at least 10 mm above or below the future tunnelling point in the tuberosity. A positioning square is available <strong>(Ref. 266 147)</strong> to position this
                wire perpendicularly to the previously implanted K-wire with stopper.</li>
            <li>Place the talar K-wire on the lateral aspect of the talus, in the lateral tubercle at the centre of the talar dome, making sure not to injure the lateral peroneal tendons.
            </li>
            <li>Palpate the medial aspect of the foot to locate the K-wires crossing the talus and calcaneus and make sure they do not perforate the skin. Fix the distractor or compressor onto the K-wires. Before starting the distraction, tighten the key
                locks to make sure the distractor does not recoil <strong>(fig. 2)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary"><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>Preparation of work chamber</md-subheader>
        <p>The third step consists of introducing the 12 mm hollow reamer (Ref. 265 573) over the first K-wire with stopper. Make sure the K-wire does not poke out of the reamer windows. Ream until the articular surface of the calcaneus is crossed; remove
            the reamer and bone plug. Reintroduce the reamer into the body of the talus and ream until the posterior surface of the talus is crossed. This reaming must be performed in two steps, as too much heat would be created if it was performed in
            a single step <strong>(fig. 3)</strong>.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary"><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>Freshening of articular surfaces
        </md-subheader>
        <p>This surgical step is very important as it will determine the success of the fusion. Depending on the patient’s case and surgical indication, bone freshening can be performed either by the work chamber or more commonly and more easily, by a small
            incision on the lateral aspect of the calcaneus below the tip of the lateral malleolus. Reflect the lateral peroneal tendons, then use a motorized burr and/or the 10 mm hollow reamer
            <strong>(Ref. 265 572)</strong> to carefully remove the talar cartilage
            <strong>(fig. 4)</strong>.<br> The intact or fractured posterior talar articular surface must also be freshened.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary"><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>Bone graft</md-subheader>
        <p>Depending on the surgical indication, a bone graft may be necessary. It isn’t always necessary for comminuted fractures. The bone plug removed at the beginning of the surgery may be sufficient. Care must be taken to release the distractor before
            introducing the nail, and always before the locking step.<br> For secondary arthrodesis after malunion or an orthopaedic indication, bone grafts are common practice. Compression may be useful after placing the bone graft. The distractor must
            be withdrawn and the compressor <strong>(Ref. 256 353)</strong> assembled on the same talar and tuberosity K-wires <strong>(fig. 5)</strong>.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary"><strong>Step 6:</strong><br>Nail placement</md-subheader>

        <p>The length of nail required is determined after again placing the nail guide (Ref. 266 291) and the nail length gauge <strong>(Ref. 266 340)</strong> and a guide <strong>(Ref. 266 291)</strong>. The nail length gauge must be pushed in until it
            is against the cortex <strong>(fig. 6a)</strong>.<br> The nail is available in three lengths: 65, 75, and 85 mm (see the reference table 3 ). Place the selected nail onto the nail holder and make sure the indicator notches are aligned, using
            the handle-nail connector screw Ø12mm.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handle-nail connector Ø12:<strong> Ref. 265 569</strong></li>
            <li>Nail holder Ø12 <strong>Ref. 265 580</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>At this stage, it is important to slide the spongy bone plug(s) that was/were removed with the hollow reamer inside the nail and to position it/them against the nail opening. This will help the arthrodesis to fuse together. The nail is then introduced
            into the work chamber with small rotating motions, then pushed up until it reaches the talar body. Its proximal tip must be at least 10 mm from the anterior cortex of the talus.<br> Once the nail is in place, put the Ø12 arthrodesis nail alignment
            frame <strong>(Ref. 265 578)</strong> onto the Ø12mm nail holder <strong>(Ref. 265 580)</strong>, using the alignment frame-nail holder connecting screw <strong>(Ref. 265 581)</strong>, in order to complete the locking step. After placement
            of the drill guide for K-wires <strong>(Ref. 266 148)</strong>, the narrow K-wires Ø1.6 Lg 200mm
            <strong>(Ref. 266 158)</strong> are introduced with a motor drive until their tip can be felt under the skin on the medial side. Use the cannulated screw length gauge <strong>(Ref. 266 146)</strong> to measure the required screw length. Typically,
            30 to 32 mm screws are used (see the reference table 4 ).<br> A screw is placed in the talar body and one or two screws in the calcaneus using the cannulated screwdriver <strong>(Ref. 254 599) (fig. 6b and 6c)</strong>. Depending on the distance
            between the end of the nail and posterior tuberosity cortex, a cap can be placed on the nail to make it easier to remove later on.<br> For secondary fusion indications (malunion with posterior tuberosity varus), a corticocancellous bone graft
            can be used. Once the graft is positioned between the talus and calcaneus <strong>(fig. 7)</strong>, the nail can be placed through the graft <strong>(fig. 7)</strong>.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Post-operative care</md-subheader>
        <p>The patient may begin moving around immediately after surgery using crutches with no weight on the foot, on the condition of wearing a pain relieving cast and that there is good wound healing, for the first fifteen days. After verifying that the
            wound is healing, a new cast is applied for a month. After the sixth week, depending on the indication of the surgery, walking with progressive weight-bearing using crutches may resume; a walking cast may also be used for added support. Physical
            therapy is usually unneeded.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Ablation of the material</md-subheader>
        <p>Ablation of material after a calcaneal fracture of subtalar arthrodesis is rarely indicated. If it proves to be necessary, ablation of the screws can be done easily by locating the screw heads on the lateral side of the heel and reinserting the
            narrow guide K-wires. The screwdriver guided by the K-wires will enable the screws to be extracted without difficulty. After making an incision in the heel, the cap can be removed (if one was placed). The nail holder is repositioned after
            cleaning the screw thread if needed. If the rotating motions of the nail holder are ineffective as a result of bone regrowth around the nail, the larger-sized hollow reamer should be used around the nail: the Ø12mm reamer for the Ø10mm fracture
            nail, the Ø14mm reamer for the Ø12mm arthrodesis nail. Ablation will then be very easy after reassembling the nail holder.
