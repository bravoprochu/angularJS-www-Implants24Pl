        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Anatomopathology of posterior facet fractures of the calcaneus</md-subheader>
        <p>Calcaneal fractures can be easily understood and analysed on the preoperative CT-scan once the position of the Palmer’s fundamental fracture line has been located. When the shear line is medial, a large lateral articular fragment will tilt and
            pivot, pushing into the calcaneal body behind the angle of Gissane or «crucial angle», just behind the sinus tarsi. This is a vertical fracture <strong>(Fig.1a).</strong><br> When the shear line is lateral, there is a large medial fragment
            that may or may not push down: most often the posterior calcaneal tuberosity and the rest of the calcaneus are moved up and displaced in a varus, flexed position. This is a horizontal fracture <strong>(Fig.1b)</strong>.<br> When the shear
            line is located in the middle of the dorsal side of the talar articular surface, the lateral fragment tilts and the medial fragment pushes down to create a double contour. This is a mixed fracture <strong>(Fig.1c)</strong>.<br> The posterior
            ending of the fracture line must also be analysed: if the retrothalmic line is located on the upper cortex of the fractured calcaneum, it is a tongue-type fracture; if the line goes toward the posterior facet of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity,
            it is a joint depression-type fracture, or a duckbill fracture.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Preoperative planning</md-subheader>
        <p>Preoperative CT scans for articular fractures of the calcaneus have become routine. Thin, contiguous slices must be made, at least 250 images of the calcaneus in order to obtain volume rendering reconstructions. Simple sagittal and horizontal
            reconstructions are not, in fact, sufficient for a quality analysis. Radiology station software or the software Osirix for Mac make it possible to create the reconstructions on one’s own. The bones surrounding the calcaneus must be removed
            step-by-step by rotating the calcaneus on its axis. This may take 5 to 15 min. depending on practice. At the end of the procedure, the superior, lateral, medial, and anterior views will make it possible to closely analyse the type of fracture,
            the exact position of the separation line, and the size of the depressed fragment(s).</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Surgical indications</md-subheader>
        <p>Vertical and mixed fractures are incongruent, so surgical indications are logical. Fractures with a horizontal depression should be operated if the loss of height assessed with the Böhler angle is significant, or roughly (10°. Horizontal and vertical
            fractures, which affect the whole joint unit, are easy to reduce. Whether the line is medial (vertical fractures) or lateral (horizontal fractures), a large, intact articular fragment only needs to be repositioned under the talus.<br> Mixed
            fractures are more difficult to treat. First the medial fragment must be reduced to correct the overlap on the medial cortex which is very visible on the CT scan, then the lateral fragment is reduced without a step between these two fragments.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Patient positioning</md-subheader>
        <p>Two positions are possible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The patient is usually placed on his/her side with the flexed limb resting on a pad and the foot off the table. Lateral and retrotibial fluoroscopy views are taken by externally rotating the foot and tipping the C-arm along the table axis.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, the patient can be placed prone with the knee flexed so the leg is placed at 45° relative to the table, particularly if it is a bilateral fracture.
            </li>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary"><strong>Step 1:</strong><br> Placement of K-wire in posterior tuberosity</md-subheader>
        <p>At the junction between the posterior and plantar aspect of the heel, use a scalpel to perform a posterior incision down to the bone. The incision starts from the lowest part of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity and goes up in a posterior direction
            for 20mm.<br> The Ø10 K-wire with stopper <strong>(Ref. 265 570)</strong> is inserted with a motor drive; it must be placed in the correct position as this determines the orientation of the work chamber and later on, the nail position.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the lateral view, the K-wire must be aligned with the posterior calcaneal bone trabeculae, about 45° top to bottom and back to front. Its proximal end must be placed under the displaced talar fragments over the lower third of the posterior
                talar articular surface <strong>(Fig.2a)</strong>.</li>
            <li>On the retrotibial view, the K-wire must be aligned with the middle of the calcaneal tuberosity axis; this roughly corresponds to the axis of the 4th interdigital space. At this point, the varus displacement of the posterior tuberosity can
                be ignored as it will be automatically corrected when the distractor is added later on <strong>(Fig.2b)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary"><strong>Step 2:</strong><br> Placement of subtalar distractor</md-subheader>
        <p>The second surgical step consists of placing a Caspar-type subtalar distractor on two K-wires, one in the talus and one in the posterior calcaneal tuberosity. This distractor <strong>(Ref. 265 599)</strong> is used to correct the varus deformity
            of the posterior tuberosity and to distract the subtalar joint so the depressed articular surface can be reduced. Two 3.2 mm K-wires <strong>(Ref. 265 668)</strong> will be placed across the foot axis. They cross the talus and the calcaneum,
            must be palpable under the medial aspect of the foot, and must not breach the skin.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> the calcaneal K-wire in the posterosuperior part of the posterior tuberosity at least 10 mm above the future tunnelling point in the tuberosity. For a tongue-type fracture ; place the wire in the inferior part. A positioning square is available
                <strong>(Ref. 266 147)</strong> to position this wire perpendicularly to the previously implanted K-wire with stopper <strong>(Fig. 3a)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Place the talar K-wire on the lateral aspect of the talus, in the lateral tubercle at the centre of the talar dome, making sure not to injure the lateral peroneal tendons <strong>(Fig. 3b)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Fix the Caspar distractor onto the K-wires (non-distracted position). Before starting the distraction, tighten the key locks to make sure the distractor does not recoil <strong>(Fig. 4)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
