<p>General, loco-regional or even local anaesthetic, depending on habits and context.</p>

<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<ul><li>Ventral decubitus position</li>
<li>Preventive haemostasis by means of a tourniquet at the root of the thigh is not essential</li>
<li>It is convenient to have a rounded pad with a sterile case to be placed on the front of the ankle
during insertion of the TENOLIG and to be moved to the instep when tightening them.</li></ul>
<p><strong>DRAWING ON THE MARKS</strong></p>
<p>Using a permanent marker, mark the following on the skin :</p>
<ul><li>The positions of the ruptured tendon ends which can always be felt very easily</li>
<li>The proximal entry points, approximately 6 cm above the rupture zone on the postero-lateral
surfaces of the tendon.</li>
<li>The exit points on the postero-lateral surfaces of the tendon, opposite the retromalleolar
spaces, 4 or 5 cm below the rupture.<br>
These marks are essential, particularly for the exit points, which must be decided on in advance
and complied with and not simply found randomly after the needle is inserted.</li></ul>

<p><strong>INSERTION OF THE 1ST TENOLIGTM</strong></p>
<p>One can decide to start with either TENOLIG - medial or lateral.
We will take the example of the medial TENOLIG.</p>
<ul><li>At the previously set entry point, a cutaneous hole of 5 to 6 mm <strong>(Fig. 1)</strong> is made using a scalpel.
Using small tweezers (Halsteadt type), the cell tissue and subcutaneous fat is divided, pushing
aside the sural nerve that could be pierced by the needle <strong>(Fig. 5)</strong>.</li>
<li>The needle is designed and curved on the basis of the proposed trajectory. Its plane is held
by strong tweezers (a large needle-holder is ideal for the job). These therefore positioned
perpendicular to the curve of the needle, thus vertically, joint downwards and rings upwards.</li>
<li>The needle must penetrate the tendon perpendicularly <strong>(Fig. 2)</strong> so that it is in the healthy zone.
Then the trajectory is adjusted to catheterise the proximal fragment, tangentially, taking care
not to push it too far in and risk damaging the internal tibial nerve.</li>
<li>With the foot in a neutral position, thanks to the pad placed on the front of the ankle, the dehiscence
is totally perceptible and one should feel the needle crossing it under one’s finger <strong>(Fig. 3)</strong>.</li>
<li>It then penetrates the distal fragment and catherises it. It should then be moved laterally. Place
the foot in the equinus position and, thanks to the action exerted on the needle by the needleholder,
it should exit by the entry point on the same side, at the previously determined point
<strong>(Fig. 4)</strong>.</li>
<li>The needle is pulled outwards until the harpoon is positioned at the level of the proximal entry
point <strong>(Fig. 5)</strong>. It is held by small tweezers, placed perpendicular to the tendon fibres and firmly
fixed into the tendon, pulling the strap distally.</li></ul>
<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(0)"></image-big>
<p><strong>INSERTION OF THE 2ND TENOLIGTM</strong></p>
 <p>This is conducted in exactly the same conditions.</p>
  <p><strong>TIGHTENING</strong></p>
<ul><li>The sterile pad is moved to the anterior surface of the instep to position the foot in a
maximum equinus position.</li>
<li>The two strap are pulled tight simultaneously <strong>(Fig. 6)</strong>. One must make sure that the harpoons
are properly anchored. To make sure of this, their lengths from their distal exit points must
be the same.</li>
<li>The plastic buttons are threaded on, convex surface against the skin.
Then the weights are also threaded onto the straps and firmly tightened in contact with the
buttons <strong>(Fig. 7)</strong>.</li>
<li>It is then essential to assess the quality of the suture after having relaxed the tension on the
straps :<br>
- by palpating the rupture zone,<br>
- by placing the leg vertically by flexing the knee to make sure that physiological equinus of
the foot is indeed retained.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is the only criterion for the correct restoration of tendon tension.
Otherwise, the weights must be removed and one must start again.</p>
<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(1)"></image-big>
<p><strong>END OF SURGERY</strong></p>
<ul><li>The distal ends of the straps are cut 2 to 3 cm from the weights.</li>
<li>The proximal ends are left and the small cutaneous incisions are closed by a stitch or, for
example, steristrips.</li>
<li>A shaped compress is slipped under each plastic button to protect the skin. A simple dressing is
then applied to cover the whole thing.</li>
<li>A resin boot holding the foot in the equinus position is made, taking care not to compress the
weights so that the skin is not damaged under the plastic buttons.</li></ul>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>As with any “blind ” technique, this is less easy than it appears.
It must be scrupulously followed if one is to draw all the benefits of the technique.
Any incorrect handling can lead to failure that is not the fault of the technique.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">ACHILLES TENDON RUPTURES</md-subheader>
<p><strong>PERCUTANEOUS TENOSYNTHESIS</strong></p>
<p>The usual therapeutic attitude of surgeons when they are faced with
the problem of Achilles tendon ruptures varies between 2 possible
solutions, depending on the case :</p>
<ul><li>pure orthopaedic treatment with immobilisation, or</li>
<li>surgical repair (whether this involves straightforward suturing or a more
complex repair). This is usually combined with strict immobilisation.</li></ul>
<p>Histological and biological studies on tendon healing have made it
possible to consider surgical repair by the <strong>percutaneous</strong> route, aimed
at early and effective physiotherapy leading to a satisfactory result
both with respect to solidity and to patient comfort.<br>
Monitoring of the results obtained over more than 15 years has
culminated in the technique that we now propose today.<br>
<strong>Percutaneous tenosynthesis</strong> combines reliability, patient comfort
and a reduction in the overall social and professional costs of this type
of injury.</p>
<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(2)"></image-big>
<p><strong>PRINCIPLES</strong></p>
<ul><li>1 To join together the two ruptured ends of the Achilles tendon
without using a surgical approach, with this join being maintained
for more than 5 weeks, at the same time permitting the immediate
mobilisation of the tendon as a unit during flexion / extension
movements of the foot.</li>
<li>2 Not to devascularise the tendon by opening up of its vascular
sheath at an untimely moment.</li>
<li>3 To preserve the hematoma around the fracture guaranteeing rapid
healing and good consolidation.</li>
<li>4 To permit early mobilisation helping to align the collagen fibres
and quickly transform them into efficient elastic tendon fibres.</li></ul>
<p><strong>EQUIPMENT USED</strong></p>
<p>TENOLIG consists of :</p>
<ul><li>a thread with a diameter of 0.85 mm and a length of 36 cm, crimped
at its proximal end, onto which is mounted a 7 mm-wide harpoon, and
crimped at its distal end by a triangular-tipped needle, 15 cm long,
slightly curved at delivery and which can be adjusted during surgery
according to a curve suitable for the type of rupture treated;</li>
<li>a perforated load for tightening;</li>
<li>an UHMW polyethylene disc, with a convex surface offering support
that does not excessively compress the skin and a flat surface.</li></ul>
<p>2 complete TENOLIG kits are
required for a standard
percutaneous tenosynthesis.
Each pack contains 2 kits.</p>
<image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(3)"></image-big>
<p><strong>INDICATION</strong></p>
<p>Surgical repair of Achilles tendon ruptures by the percutaneous route.
It is preferable to conduct this procedure within <strong>8 days</strong> following rupture.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">POST OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT & REHABILITATION</md-subheader>
<p>Based on our current knowledge of tendon healing, the post-surgical period can be divided into 4 successive phases. The success of the
percutaneous tenosynthesis depends on these 4 phases being respected.</p>
