<p>General, loco-regional or even local anaesthetic, depending on habits and context.</p>

<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<ul><li>Ventral decubitus position</li>
<li>Preventive haemostasis by means of a tourniquet at the root of the thigh is not essential</li>
<li>It is convenient to have a rounded pad with a sterile case to be placed on the front of the ankle
during insertion of the TENOLIG and to be moved to the instep when tightening them.</li></ul>
<p><strong>DRAWING ON THE MARKS</strong></p>
<p>Using a permanent marker, mark the following on the skin :</p>
<ul><li>The positions of the ruptured tendon ends which can always be felt very easily</li>
<li>>The proximal entry points, approximately 6 cm above the rupture zone on the postero-lateral
surfaces of the tendon.</li>
<li>The exit points on the postero-lateral surfaces of the tendon, opposite the retromalleolar
spaces, 4 or 5 cm below the rupture.<br>
These marks are essential, particularly for the exit points, which must be decided on in advance
and complied with and not simply found randomly after the needle is inserted.</li></ul>
