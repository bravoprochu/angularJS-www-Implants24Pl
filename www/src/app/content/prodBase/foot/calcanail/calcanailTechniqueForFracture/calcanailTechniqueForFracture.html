            <div class="md-body-1">
                Calcaneal fractures can be easily understood and analysed on the preoperative CT-scan
                once the position of the Palmer’s fundamental fracture line has been located.
                When the shear line is medial, a large lateral articular fragment will tilt and pivot,
                pushing into the calcaneal body behind the angle of Gissane or «crucial angle», just
                behind the sinus tarsi. This is a vertical fracture (Fig.1a).<br />
                When the shear line is lateral, there is a large medial fragment that may or may not push
                down: most often the posterior calcaneal tuberosity and the rest of the calcaneus are
                moved up and displaced in a varus, flexed position. This is a horizontal fracture (Fig.1b).
                When the shear line is located in the middle of the dorsal side of the talar articular surface,
                the lateral fragment tilts and the medial fragment pushes down to create a double
                contour. This is a mixed fracture (Fig.1c).<br />
                The posterior ending of the fracture line must also be analysed: if the retrothalmic line
                is located on the upper cortex of the fractured calcaneum, it is a tongue-type fracture; if
                the line goes toward the posterior facet of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity, it is a joint depression-type fracture, or a duckbill fracture.<br />

                Preoperative CT scans for articular fractures of the calcaneus have become
                routine. Thin, contiguous slices must be made, at least 250 images of the calcaneus
                in order to obtain volume rendering reconstructions. Simple sagittal
                and horizontal reconstructions are not, in fact, sufficient for a quality analysis.
                Radiology station software or the software Osirix for Mac make it possible to
                create the reconstructions on one’s own. The bones surrounding the calcaneus
                must be removed step-by-step by rotating the calcaneus on its axis.
                This may take 5 to 15 min. depending on practice. At the end of the procedure,
                the superior, lateral, medial, and anterior views will make it possible to
                closely analyse the type of fracture, the exact position of the separation line,
                and the size of the depressed fragment(s).<br />

            <div class="md-body-1">
                Vertical and mixed fractures are incongruent, so surgical indications are logical.
                Fractures with a horizontal depression should be operated if the loss of
                height assessed with the Böhler angle is significant, or roughly <10°.<br />
                Horizontal and vertical fractures, which affect the whole joint unit, are easy
                to reduce. Whether the line is medial (vertical fractures) or lateral (horizontal
                fractures), a large, intact articular fragment only needs to be repositioned
                under the talus.<br />
                Mixed fractures are more difficult to treat. First the medial fragment must be
                reduced to correct the overlap on the medial cortex which is very visible on
                the CT scan, then the lateral fragment is reduced without a step between
                these two fragments.

            <div class="md-body-1">
                At the junction between the posterior and plantar aspect
                of the heel, use a scalpel to perform a posterior incision
                down to the bone. The incision starts from the lowest part
                of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity and goes up in a posterior
                direction for 20mm.
                The Ø10 K-wire with stopper (Ref. 265 570) is inserted with a
                motor drive; it must be placed in the correct position as this determines the orientation
                of the work chamber and later on, the nail position.
                • On the lateral view, the K-wire must be aligned with the posterior calcaneal bone
                trabeculae, about 45° top to bottom and back to front. Its proximal end must be
                placed under the displaced talar fragments over the lower third of the posterior
                talar articular surface (Fig.2a).
                • On the retrotibial view, the K-wire must be aligned with the middle of the calcaneal
                tuberosity axis; this roughly corresponds to the axis of the 4th interdigital space. At
                this point, the varus displacement of the posterior tuberosity can be ignored as it
                will be automatically corrected when the distractor is added later on (Fig.2b).

            <div class="md-subhead">Placement of subtalar distractor</div>
            <div class="md-body-1">
                The second surgical step consists of placing a Caspar-type subtalar distractor
                on two K-wires, one in the talus and one in the posterior calcaneal tuberosity.
                This distractor (Ref. 265 599) is used to correct the varus deformity of the posterior
                tuberosity and to distract the subtalar joint so the depressed articular
                surface can be reduced. Two 3.2 mm K-wires (Ref. 265 668) will be placed across
                the foot axis. They cross the talus and the calcaneum, must be palpable under
                the medial aspect of the foot, and must not breach the skin.
                • Place the calcaneal K-wire in the posterosuperior part of the posterior tuberosity
                at least 10 mm above the future tunnelling point in the tuberosity.
                For a tongue-type fracture ; place the wire in the inferior part. A positioning
                square is available (Ref. 266 147) to position this wire perpendicularly to
                the previously implanted K-wire with stopper (Fig. 3a).
                • Place the talar K-wire on the lateral aspect of the talus, in the lateral tubercle
                at the centre of the talar dome, making sure not to injure the lateral peroneal
                tendons (Fig. 3b).
                • Fix the Caspar distractor onto the K-wires (non-distracted position). Before
                starting the distraction, tighten the key locks to make sure the distractor
                does not recoil (Fig. 4).

                The third step consists of introducing the 10 mm hollow reamer (Ref. 265 572) over the first K-wire with
                stopper (Fig. 5). Make sure the K-wire does not poke out of the reamer windows. Aim the hollow reamer
                below the depressed articular fragments, without making them more fragile, and above the critical
                angle (Angle of Gissane). Remove the hollow reamer and the K-wire with stopper; a 2-3 cm bone plug
                can then be removed and may be used at the end of the procedure (Fig. 6).

                bones.
                <strong>
                    The distractor can be used with some force, even if it causes minor
                    damage to the skin near the K-wires which can be sutured when the
                    incision in closed (fig. 6a).
                </strong>
                Use the specific curved tamp (Ref. 265 575), straight tamp (Ref. 265 576), spatula
                (Ref. 265 586), and light mallet taps to free up the fragments and push them
                towards the talus into the empty space created by the distractor. Begin by
                pushing the medial fragment to correct the overlap of the medial cortex
                (Fig. 6b and 6c), then reduce the lateral fragment by changing the orientation
                of the curved tamp (fig. 6d and 6e). Use lateral fluoroscopy views to track the
                reduction until the subtalar joint line is congruent and the critical angle of
                Gissane is restored. (Fig. 7). At the end of the procedure, verify the reduction
                on the retrotibial view.

                <br />
                <strong>The nail length gauge must be pushed in until it is against the cortex.</strong>
                The nail is available in three lengths: 45, 50 and 55 mm (see the reference
                table 1 ). Place the selected nail onto the nail holder and make sure the indicator
                notches are aligned (Fig. 8a), using the handle-nail connector screw (10mm

                Once the nail is in place, put the Ø10 fracture nail alignment frame (Ref. 265 577)
                onto the nail holder to perform the locking step using the Alignment framenail
                holder connecting screw (Ref. 265 581). After placement of the drill guide for
                K-wires (Ref. 266 148), the K-wires for cannulated screws Ø1.6 Lg 200mm (Ref. 266 158)
                are introduced with a motor drive until their tip can be felt under the skin on
                the medial side (fig. 9a and 9b).

                Use the cannulated screw length gauge (Ref. 266 146) to measure the required
                screw length. Typically, 30 to 32 mm screws are used (see the reference table 2 ).
                After removing the drill guide for K-wires, use the Ø3.7 mm cannulated drill
                bit (Ref. 265 587) (Fig. 10a). The screws are placed using a cannulated screwdriver
                (Ref. 254 599) and tightened enough to compress the bones and reduce the
                calcaneus transversely (Fig. 10b and 10c).<br />
                On the axial view, check that the screws are well inserted. Furthermore, if the
                interfragmentary gap needs to be reduced at the separation line, the screw
                can be tightened until it makes contact with the nail, which will provide
                excellent interfragmentary compression.<br />
                Once the locking step is completed, the distractor can be withdrawn.<br />

                    Surgical tips and tricks:
                    joint depression-type frac tures
                </strong><br />
                Tongue-type fractures or duckbill fractures are sometimes difficult
                to reduce. It may be helpful to insert a Steinmann pin in the
                fragment and reduce the displacement using a levering motion
                as one would for closed lifting-nailing. It may also be useful to
                open up access to the fragment at the Angle of Gissane using the
                spatula (Ref. 265 586). Lastly, it is possible to perfect the closure of
                the posterior duckbill by introducing an oblique screw through the
                fibres of the Achilles tendon and putting it through the openings of
                the nail and the plantar cortex.

                Depending on the distance between the end of the nail and posterior tuberosity
                cortex, a cap can be placed on the nail to make it easier to remove later
                on. The cap is positioned with the screwdriver. The threading can be found
                easily with several back-and-forth motions of the screwdriver (fig. 10d).
