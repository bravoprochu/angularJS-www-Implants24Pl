                The usual therapeutic attitude of surgeons when they are faced with
                the problem of Achilles tendon ruptures varies between 2 possible
                solutions, depending on the case :
                <ul>
                    <li>pure orthopaedic treatment with immobilisation, or</li>
                    <li>
                        surgical repair (whether this involves straightforward suturing or a more
                        complex repair). This is usually combined with strict immobilisation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Histological and biological studies on tendon healing have made it
                possible to consider surgical repair by the percutaneous route, aimed
                at early and effective physiotherapy leading to a satisfactory result
                both with respect to solidity and to patient comfort.<br />
                Monitoring of the results obtained over more than 15 years has
                culminated in the technique that we now propose today.<br />
                Percutaneous tenosynthesis combines reliability, patient comfort
                and a reduction in the overall social and professional costs of this type
                of injury.

                        To join together the two ruptured ends of the Achilles tendon
                        without using a surgical approach, with this join being maintained
                        for more than 5 weeks, at the same time permitting the immediate
                        mobilisation of the tendon as a unit during flexion / extension
                        movements of the foot.

                    <li>
                        Not to devascularise the tendon by opening up of its vascular
                        sheath at an untimely moment.

                    <li>
                        To preserve the hematoma around the fracture guaranteeing rapid
                        healing and good consolidation.

                    <li>
                        To permit early mobilisation helping to align the collagen fibres
                        and quickly transform them into efficient elastic tendon fibres.

                TENOLIG consists of :
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a thread with a diameter of 0.85 mm and a length of 36 cm, crimped
                        at its proximal end, onto which is mounted a 7 mm-wide harpoon, and
                        crimped at its distal end by a triangular-tipped needle, 15 cm long,
                        slightly curved at delivery and which can be adjusted during surgery
                        according to a curve suitable for the type of rupture treated;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a perforated load for tightening;

                    <li>
                        an UHMW polyethylene disc, with a convex surface offering support
                        that does not excessively compress the skin and a flat surface.

                2 complete TENOLIG kits are
                required for a standard
                percutaneous tenosynthesis.
                Each pack contains 2 kits.
