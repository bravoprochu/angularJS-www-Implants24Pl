            <div class="md-body-1">
                Using a permanent marker, mark the following on the skin:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The positions of the ruptured tendon ends which can always be felt very easily
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The proximal entry points, approximately 6 cm above the rupture zone on the postero-lateral
                        surfaces of the tendon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The exit points on the postero-lateral surfaces of the tendon, opposite the retromalleolar
                        spaces, 4 or 5 cm below the rupture.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                These marks are essential, particularly for the exit points, which must be decided on in advance
                and complied with and not simply found randomly after the needle is inserted.

            <div class="md-title">INSERTION OF THE 1ST TENOLIGTM</div>
            <div class="md-body-1">
                One can decide to start with either TENOLIG - medial or lateral.<br />
                We will take the example of the medial TENOLIG.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At the previously set entry point, a cutaneous hole of 5 to 6 mm (Fig. 1) is made using a scalpel.
                        Using small tweezers (Halsteadt type), the cell tissue and subcutaneous fat is divided, pushing
                        aside the sural nerve that could be pierced by the needle (Fig. 5).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The needle is designed and curved on the basis of the proposed trajectory. Its plane is held
                        by strong tweezers (a large needle-holder is ideal for the job). These therefore positioned
                        perpendicular to the curve of the needle, thus vertically, joint downwards and rings upwards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The needle must penetrate the tendon perpendicularly (Fig. 2) so that it is in the healthy zone.
                        Then the trajectory is adjusted to catheterise the proximal fragment, tangentially, taking care
                        not to push it too far in and risk damaging the internal tibial nerve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the foot in a neutral position, thanks to the pad placed on the front of the ankle, the dehiscence
                        is totally perceptible and one should feel the needle crossing it under one’s finger (Fig. 3).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It then penetrates the distal fragment and catherises it. It should then be moved laterally. Place
                        the foot in the equinus position and, thanks to the action exerted on the needle by the needleholder,
                        it should exit by the entry point on the same side, at the previously determined point
                        (Fig. 4).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The needle is pulled outwards until the harpoon is positioned at the level of the proximal entry
                        point (Fig. 5). It is held by small tweezers, placed perpendicular to the tendon fibres and firmly
                        fixed into the tendon, pulling the strap distally.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                These marks are essential, particularly for the exit points, which must be decided on in advance
                and complied with and not simply found randomly after the needle is inserted.

                        The sterile pad is moved to the anterior surface of the instep to position the foot in a
                        maximum equinus position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The two strap are pulled tight simultaneously (Fig. 6). One must make sure that the harpoons
                        are properly anchored. To make sure of this, their lengths from their distal exit points must
                        be the same.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The plastic buttons are threaded on, convex surface against the skin.
                        Then the weights are also threaded onto the straps and firmly tightened in contact with the
                        buttons (Fig. 7).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is then essential to assess the quality of the suture after having relaxed the tension on the
                        straps :<br />
                        - by palpating the rupture zone,<br />
                        - by placing the leg vertically by flexing the knee to make sure that physiological equinus of
the foot is indeed retained.
                    </li>
                    This is the only criterion for the correct restoration of tendon tension.<br />
                    Otherwise, the weights must be removed and one must start again.
                </ul>

                As with any “blind ” technique, this is less easy than it appears.
                It must be scrupulously followed if one is to draw all the benefits of the technique.<br />
                Any incorrect handling can lead to failure that is not the fault of the technique.
