        <p><strong>DUAL MOBILITY ACETABULAR CUP</strong></p>
        <p>The dual mobility concept was invented by Prof. Bousquet more than twenty years ago. It is based on the combination of two principles :<br> - Joint stability ;<br> - Reduction of wear.<br> FH ORTHOPEDICS has reworked this concept, this time taking
            into account the technological progress made since the 1970s in terms of the materials, so as to obtain improved tribological results. The <strong>Hip’n go</strong> dual mobility acetabular cup comes in a large range and makes it possible
            to satisfy a maximum of indications.</p>

        <p>The universal Hip’n go concept makes it possible to choose, in either the pre-operative or per-operative period, between a dual mobility acetabular cup (press-fit or tripod) and a rigid acetabular cup (Biolox Delta® ceramic or UHMWPE insert).</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">RANGE and MATERIALS</md-subheader>
        <p>The tripod dual mobility range of cementless acetabular cups is available in 10 sizes, ranging from a diameter 46 mm to 64 mm in 2 mm increments. The inserts are available with an inner diameter of 22.2 mm for size 46 and an inner diameter of
            28 mm for sizes 48 to 64 mm.<br> • The metal-backs are made from mirror polished CoCr (cobalt chromium) on the inner face to provide mobilisation of the insert with maximum tribological properties.<br> • The outside surface has a titanium
            T40 spray and a hydroxyapatite coating to increase the implant’s secondary fixation capacities*.<br> • The plugs are made of M30 stainless steel, and are alumina-blasted on the bone anchoring part.<br> • The inserts are made from UHMWPE (Ultra
            High Molecular Weight PolyEthylene).</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">PRESS-FIT</md-subheader>
        <p>The metal-back of the <strong> Hip’n go </strong> dual mobility acetabular cup is a semi-circular cup that is flared at the equator because of a serrated macrostructure that provides it with excellent press-fit capacities and perfect primary fixation.
            The macrostructure also has three wings, making it possible to increase the press-fit, as well as prevent any possible rotation of the cup in the receiving bone.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">STABILITY</md-subheader>
        <p>In order to apply the stability principles developed by Prof. Bousquet, the semi-circular part of the cup is elongated in its upper part by a 4mm lip, which helps to improve the congruence of the system.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">INSERT</md-subheader>
        <p>The minimum thickness of the polyethylene inserts is 8 mm, to prevent any risk of creep. The geometry of the inserts has been studied to make maximum head/insert clearance possible, as well as linear contact insert/neck as a means of reducing
            wear. It is for this reason that the inserts are equipped with an inner bevelled edge. These inserts come in two diameters: 22.2 mm for size 46 and 28 mm for sizes 48 and up.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">PLUGS and MALLEABLE LUG</md-subheader>
        <p>The plugs for the Hip’n go tripod dual mobility acetabular cup are put into place in the cup by means of impaction. An inner thread has been added to make them easier to remove, if necessary. The tripod lug, like the rest of the cup, is made of
            cobalt chrome. It accepts the rounded-head cortical screws, ranging in size from 30 to 60 mm, all delivered with an instrument set. The malleable lug must be adjusted on the roof of the acetabular cup.</p>

        <p>The specific <strong> Hip’n go </strong> instruments set can be used with both types of cementless dual mobility acetabular cups proposed in this programme.
            <br> This instrument set allows surgeons to use every approach available, including mini-invasive approaches.<br> Impaction tools are available, either for posterior or anterior approaches.
