        <p><strong>DUAL MOBILITY ACETABULAR CUP</strong></p>
        <p>The dual mobility concept was invented by Prof. Gilles Bousquet more than twenty years ago. It results from the combination of two principles:
            <br> • joint stability;<br> • reduction in implant wear.<br> FH Orthopedics has reworked this concept, taking into account the technological progress made since the 1970s concerning the materials used, to obtain improved tribological results.</p>

        <p>The universal Hip’n go concept makes it possible to choose, in either the preoperative or intraoperative period, between a dual mobility acetabular cup (press-fit, tripod or cemented) and a rigid acetabular cup (Biolox Delta ceramic or UHMWPE
            insert).

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">RANGE and MATERIALS</md-subheader>
        <p>The range of cemented dual mobility acetabular cups has 10 sizes, from 46 to 64 mm in diameter, with 2 mm increments. The inserts are available with an inner diameter of 22.2 mm for the 46 mm size and an inner diameter of 28 mm for the 48 to 64
            mm sizes.
            <br> • The metal backs are made from CoCr (cobalt chrome) mirror polished on the inner surface to allow movement of the insert with maximum tribological properties. The external surfaces are also mirror polished and grooved allowing compression
            and maximum adhesion of the cement.<br> • The inserts are manufactured in UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight PolyEthylene).</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">STABILITY</md-subheader>
        <p>To apply the principles of stability developed by Prof. Bousquet, the superior edge of the hemispherical part of the cup is extended by 4 mm to improve the congruence of the system.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">INSERTS</md-subheader>
        <p>The minimum thickness of the polyethylene inserts is 8 mm, to avoid any risk of creep. The geometry of the inserts has been designed to provide maximum head/insert movement and linear insert/neck contact to limit wear; for this reason the inserts
            have an internal bevelled edge. These inserts are available with diameters of 22.2 mm (for size 46) and 28 mm (for sizes 48 and greater).</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">ACETABULAR REINFORCEMENT</md-subheader>
        <p>The Hip’n go cemented dual mobility range of acetabular cups is complemented by a range of acetabular reinforcements of the Kerboull cross plate type. These plates for acetabular reconstruction are available with 4 internal diameters:<br> • Ø
            50 mm;<br> • Ø 54 mm;<br> • Ø 58 mm;<br> • Ø 62 mm.<br> This stainless steel acetabular reinforcement has:<br> • a tab on its proximal part allowing it to be fixed with 3 cortical screws;
            <br> • a central thread for prehension and easier fitting;<br> • 4 polyethylene lugs to ensure regular thickness of the cement of<br> 1.5 mm and also to eliminate the risk of galvanic corrosion through the absence of contact between the different
            materials of the plate and acetabular cup.</p>
