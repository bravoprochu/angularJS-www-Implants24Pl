        <p><strong>PRESS-FIT ACETABULAR CUP</strong></p>
        <p>For more than 20 years, FH ORTHOPEDICS is specialised in manufacturing cementless total hip prostheses.<br> The Hip’n go range of acetabular cups is the natural step forward, applying the latest technological advances made in the field of friction
            couples, metal work and instruments.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">CONCEPT</md-subheader>
        <p>The universal Hip’n go concept makes it possible to choose, in either the pre-operative or per-operative period, between :<br> - a rigid acetabular cup (ceramic or UHMWPE insert)<br> - a dual mobility acetabular cup (press-fit or tripod).<br>            The rigid Hip’n go acetabular cup allows surgeons to choose, on the basis of the indications and the age of the patients, either a classic polyethylene insert or a ceramic insert with a large diameter head. The ceramic insert, which requires
            the use of large diameters (32 mm from S46 and 36 mm from S52), makes it possible to reduce problems of instability or wear.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">RANGE and MATERIALS</md-subheader>
        <p>There are 10 sizes in the Hip’n go cementless range of rigid acetabular cups, from a diameter of 46 mm to 64 mm in 2 mm increments. There is also an optional range that goes up to size 74 mm.<br> • The metal-backs are made from a TA6 V4 titanium
            alloy. The outside surface has a T40 titanium spary and a hydroxyapatite coating that facilitates the secondary fixation of the implant in the long term.<br> • The inserts are made from :<br> - UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight PolyEthylene)
            and are available in the 28 mm diameter size.<br> - Biolox Delta ceramic for its recognised tribological properties and increased resistance to fracture.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">PRESS-FIT of the METAL-BACK</md-subheader>
        <p>The metal-back of the rigid acetabular cup is a semi-circular cup that is flared at the equator because of a serrated macrostructure that provides it with excellent press-fit qualities and perfect primary fixation. The macrostructure also has
            three wings, making it possible to increase the press-fit as well as prevent any possible rotation of the cup in the receiving bone.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">METAL-BACK</md-subheader>
        <p>The inner face of the metal-back has been carefully studied so as to allow the inserts to be fixated perfectly. The fixation of the ceramic inserts is obtained by means of a micro-threaded Morse cone of 18°. The fixation of the PE inserts is obtained
            thanks to 12 notches, tooled into the mass, and which house the polyethylene fixation so as to orient the insert by increments of 30°.<br> In addition to these notches, there is a lip visible at the level of the cup. The purpose of this lip
            is to allow the PE inserts to be clipped into place, thus allowing them to be fixed correctly.<br> The cup, which has 3 holes for the possible use of flat-headed cancellous screws, made of a titanium alloy ranging in size from 15 to 60 mm
            (a screw rack is provided with the instruments set).</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">PE INSERT</md-subheader>
        <p>The minimum thickness of the polyethylene inserts is 8 mm, to prevent creep. They come equipped with 12 notches that make it impossible to mobilise the insert and allow surgeons to orient the posterior wall. There is a lip for clipping the inserts
            into the cup. The inserts are available in a 28 mm model, either with a flat edge (Charnley type), or with a 4 mm posterior wall (named PE STANDARD).

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">CERAMIC INSERT</md-subheader>
        <p>The ceramic inserts made of Biolox Delta alumina make it possible to use Ø 32 mm heads (from size 46) and Ø 36 mm (from size 52), thus reducing the risk of dislocation. This type of ceramic has been recognised for its properties of resistance
            to fracture, as well as hardness, which reduces the possible wear to the insert and thus increases its lifespan.</p>
