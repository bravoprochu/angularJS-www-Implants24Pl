        <p>The dual mobility concept was invented by Prof. Gilles Bousquet more than twenty years ago. It is based on the combination of two principles:<br> - Joint stability<br> - Reduction of wear<br> FH ORTHOPEDICS has reworked this concept, this time
            taking into account the technological progress made since the 1970s in terms of the materials used, so as to obtain improved tribological results.<br>
            <strong>The Hip’n go dual mobility acetabular cup </strong> comes in a large range and makes it possible to satisfy a maximum of indications.</p>

        <p>The universal Hip’n go concept makes it possible to choose, in either the pre-operative or per-operative period, between a dual mobility acetabular cup (press-fit or tripod) and a rigid acetabular cup (Biolox Delta® ceramic or UHMWPE insert).</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">RANGE and MATERIALS</md-subheader>
        <p>The range of <strong>dual mobility cementless acetabular cups</strong> comes in 10 sizes, ranging from a diameter 46 mm to 64 mm in 2 mm increments. The inserts are available with an inner diameter of 22.2 mm for size 46 and an inner diameter
            of 28 mm for sizes 48 to 64 mm. • The metal-backs are made from mirror polished CoCr (cobalt chromium) on the inner face to provide mobilisation of the insert with maximum tribological properties.<br> The outside surface has a T40 titanium
            spray and a hydroxyapatite coating to increase both the implant’s secondary fixation capacities and its lifespan*.<br> • The inserts are made from<strong> UHMWPE</strong> (Ultra High Molecular Weight PolyEthylene).

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">PRESS-FIT</md-subheader>
        <p>The metal-back of the <strong>Hip’n go </strong> dual mobility acetabular cup is a semicircular cup that is flared at the equator because of a serrated macrostructure that provides it with excellent press-fit capacities and perfect primary fixation.
            The press-fit is increased by three peripheral wings, which also prevent any possible rotation of the cup in the receiving bone.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">STABILITY</md-subheader>
        <p>In order to apply the stability principles developed by Prof. Bousquet, the semi-circular part of the cup is elongated in its upper part by a 4mm lip, which helps to improve the congruence of the system.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">INSERT</md-subheader>
        <p>The minimum thickness of the polyethylene inserts is 8 mm, to prevent any risk of creep. The geometry of the inserts has been studied to make maximum head/insert clearance possible, as well as linear contact insert/neck as a means of reducing
            wear. It is for this reason that the inserts are equipped with an inner bevelled edge. These inserts come in two diameters : 22.2 mm for size 46 and 28 mm for sizes 48 and up.</p>

        <p>The specific <strong> Hip’n go</strong> instruments set can be used with both types of cementless dual mobility acetabular cups proposed in this programme: press-fit and tripod.<br> This instrument set allows surgeons to use every approach available,
            including mini-invasive approaches.<br> Impaction tools are available, either for posterior or anterior approaches
