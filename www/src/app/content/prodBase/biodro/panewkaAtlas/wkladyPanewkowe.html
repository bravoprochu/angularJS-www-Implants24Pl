        <p>The stability of the insert is, obviously, essential. To avoid the insert creeping, it has been designed with a cylindrical peripheral zone and a rough interior surface on the metal-back, created using alumina blasting. These technical elements
            have proved their effectiveness over the past 20 years and over 150,000 implantations. This fixation ensures that there is no micro-movement of the insert within the metal-back, proven by observing the machining lines, which are still visible,
            on inserts removed after over 10 years.</p>
