        <md-subheader class="md-primary">THE CONCEPT</md-subheader>
        <p>The ATLAS concept, born in 1985 as a result of Dr Alain Dambreville’s research. This cementless elastic acetabular
            cup immediately appealed to a large number of surgeons, who continue to implant several thousand each year, across
            the world. This is success is due in part to its easiness to implant and its excellent results, linked to its
            essential principles:
            <br> 1- Primary stability, through its press-fit;<br> 2- Stability of the insert inside the metal-back;<br> 3-
            Secondary fixation due to surface coatings;<br> 4- Thickness of the PE.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">RANGE AND MATERIALS</md-subheader>
        <p>The three types of <strong>ATLAS metal-back</strong> are made from a titanium alloy, TA 6V4 ELI, with a constant
            2.5 mm thickness. All three include:<br> - a slot providing the cup with the elasticity to ensure a perfect and
            instant press-fit and risk-free impacting for the supporting bone.
            <br> - inside sand–blasted and a cylindrical equatorial zone, to ensure the insert’s stability.<br> - a hydroxyapatite
            coating for secondary fixation.</p>
        <p><strong>The ATLAS IIIP</strong> is fitted with 4 spikes which fit into the bone to avoid any rotation of the cup
            and also screw holes for screw fixation, if necessary.</p>
        <image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(00)"></image-big>
        <p><strong>The ATLAS IVP</strong> also has spikes, but no screw holes.</p>
        <image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(01)"></image-big>
        <p>
            <STRONG>The ATLAS MS</STRONG> was designed without spikes, to meet LIS requirements (Less Invasive Surgery). Like the <strong>ATLAS III P</strong>,
            it has 3 screw holes. The four spikes are replaced with a rougher surface coating, obtained through projection
            of T40 porous titanium, before the HAP.</p>
        <image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(02)"></image-big>
        <P>The ATLAS metal-back range can be combined with a wide range of highly cross-linked polyethylene (TRIANON) or conventional
            inserts, available in various internal diameters (22.22; 28; 32 and 36mm) and shapes (flat-edged; posterior wall;
            anti-dislocation wall). For over 20 years, FH ORT HOPEDICS has specialized in the production of cementless total
            hip prostheses. The ATLAS acetabular cup was developed using this expertise and the latest technological advances
            in terms of bearing, metallurgy and instrumentation.</P>

    <md-subheader class="md-primary">PRESS-FIT</md-subheader>
    <p>The ATLAS acetabular cup
has a slot which closes
during impacting, to
facilitate penetration into the
acetabulum. When the insert
is impacted, this slot returns to
its initial position, applying a
major coaptational force onto
the bone. Only an elastic cup
allows this kind of press-fit.
The elasticity of the metalback
improves transmission of
constraints.</p>

   <md-subheader class="md-primary">STABILITY OF THE INSERT</md-subheader>    
   <p>The stability of the insert is, obviously,
essential. To avoid the insert tipping,
it has been designed with a cylindrical
equatorial zone and a rough interior
surface on the metal-back, created
using sand blasting.<br>
These technical elements have proved
their effectiveness over the past 20
years and over 150,000 implantations.<br>
This fixation ensures that there is no
micro-movement of the insert within
the metal-back, proven by observing
the machining lines, which are still
visible, on inserts removed after over
10 years. </p>

    <md-subheader class="md-primary">COATING</md-subheader>
    <p>Secondary fixation through surface coating has benefitted
from all the progress made over the past 25 years. The
bioactive Hydroxyapatite 120μm coating has already proven its
effectiveness. Bone adherence to the surface of the prosthesis is
fast and long lasting, even over the long term, after absorption of
the hydroxyapatite (HAP).<br>
Close osteointegration with no interposition of fibrous tissues,
as a result of using HAP, limits the risk of periprosthetic
osteolysis, by countering the migration of wear particles.</p>

  <md-subheader class="md-primary">PE THICKNESSES</md-subheader>  
  <p>ATLAS ’s 2.5 mm thickness allows for PE thicknesses of over
10mm in traditional UHMWPE and highly cross-linked
polyethylene, providing excellent resistance to creepage. </p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">EXTREME SIZES</md-subheader> 
        <p>The ATLAS range of cups starts with diameter 46 and is available
through to size 74 in the ATLAS III P version. This wide range
of sizes provides surgeons with a solution, even in cases of cup
revision.</p>
