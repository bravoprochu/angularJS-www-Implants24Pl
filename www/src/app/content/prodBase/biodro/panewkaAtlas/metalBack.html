<md-subheader class="md-primary">THE CONCEPT</md-subheader>
<p>The ATLAS concept, born in 1985 as a result of Dr Alain Dambreville’s
research. This cementless elastic acetabular cup immediately appealed
to a large number of surgeons, who continue to implant several
thousand each year, across the world. This is success is due in part to
its easiness to implant and its excellent results, linked to its essential
principles:<br>
1- Primary stability, through its press-fit;<br>
2- Stability of the insert inside the metal-back;<br>
3- Secondary fixation due to surface coatings;<br>
4- Thickness of the PE.</p>

<p>The three types of <strong>ATLAS metal-back</strong> are made from a titanium alloy,
TA 6V4 ELI, with a constant 2.5 mm thickness. All three include:<br>
- a slot providing the cup with the elasticity to ensure a perfect
and instant press-fit and risk-free impacting for the supporting
bone.<br>
- inside sand–blasted and a cylindrical equatorial zone, to
ensure the insert’s stability.<br>
- a hydroxyapatite coating for secondary fixation.</p>
<p><strong>The ATLAS IIIP</strong> is fitted with 4 spikes which fit into the bone to avoid
any rotation of the cup and also screw holes for screw fixation,
if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>The ATLAS IVP</strong> also has spikes, but no screw holes.</p>

 <p><STRONG>The ATLAS MS</STRONG> was designed without spikes, to meet LIS requirements
(Less Invasive Surgery). Like the <strong>ATLAS III P</strong>, it has 3 screw holes. The
four spikes are replaced with a rougher surface coating, obtained
through projection of T40 porous titanium, before the HAP.</p>

 <P>The ATLAS metal-back range can be combined with a wide range of
highly cross-linked polyethylene (TRIANON) or conventional inserts,
available in various internal diameters (22.22; 28; 32 and 36mm) and
shapes (flat-edged; posterior wall; anti-dislocation wall).
