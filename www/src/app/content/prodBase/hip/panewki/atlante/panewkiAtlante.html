                    <strong>Cementless press-fit cup</strong>&nbsp;
                    The ATLANTE 2 cup has been specially designed to
                    provide a perfectly suitable interface for the bone
                    elasticity module, but also allowing easy, precise and
                    safe implementation of a ceramic insert.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    The pre-mounted ring around the ceramic is designed
                    to provide maximum protection to the ceramic, in
                    cases of extreme positions, whilst maintaining the
                    range of motion and stability associated with largediameter
                    heads.</p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the user's preference, the ATLANTE 2
                    cup can be used with either a ceramic insert or a
                    TRIANON® highly cross-linked polyethylene insert, in the same metal-back.

                    For over 20 years, FH ORTHOPEDICS has been specialising in the
                    production of cementless implants for total hip prosthesis.
                    The ATLANTE II cup applies the latest technological progress in
                    terms of bearings, metallurgy and instrumentation to this expertise.

                <p>
                    The concept of the ATLANTE 2 cup is based on our experience with
                    the metal-back ATLANTE cup, in use since 2001; combined with
                    current bearings.

                <p>
                    The ATLANTE 2 cup provides surgeons with a choice, based on
                    the indications and patient age, between a TRIANON® highly
                    crosslinked PE liner or a massive ceramic insert with a titanium
                    ring, with a large-diameter head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both types of inserts allow large diameter heads to be used, to avoid
                    problems of instability and wear.

                    The ATLANTE 2 range of rigid cementless cups includes 10 sizes with
                    diameters ranging from 46mm to 64mm in 2mm increments.

                <p>
                    The metal-back cups are made from a Ti Al6 V4 titanium alloy. The
                    external surface is sand-blasted and has a hydroxyapatite coating,
                    which promotes secondary fixation of the implant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inserts are made from:

                            Biolox® Delta® ceramic for its recognised tribological
                            properties and its increased fracture resistance, with a
                            titanium ring.

                    The ATLANTE 2 rigid cup metal-back is a hemispheric cup with an
                    equatorial flare, due to its serrated macrostructure, which give it
                    an excellent press-fit and perfect primary fixation.

                    The internal surface of the metal-back has been designed to provide
                    perfect fixation of inserts. Ceramic inserts are fixed by wedging,
                    using a micro-threaded 14° morse taper. PE inserts are fixed using
                    12 notches, mass-produced, which hold the slots in the polyethylene,
                    to direct it in 30° steps. It also has a lip for increased stability.
                    The cup has three holes for the use of flat-head titanium cancellous
                    bone screws, if necessary, which are available in sizes 15 to 40mm
                    (a screw rack is included in the instrumentation set).

                    The polyethylene liners for the ATLANTE 2 cup are highly crosslinked
                    (TRIANON®). This material <strong>improves the bearing to reduce wear</strong>,
                    but also allows <strong>the use of large-diameter heads (32mm
                    and 36mm)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The TRIANON® polyethylene inserts have a minimum thickness of
                    8mm, to avoid any risk of creepage. They are fitted with 12 notches
                    to prevent movement of the liner and allow the exterior wall to be
                    aligned. The lip is present to fix inserts by clipping into the cup.
                    These liners are available in 28mm, 32mm and 36mm diameters,
                    in a flat-edged version (charnley type), or with a 4 mm external wall
                    (called STANDARD PE).

                    The massive ceramic inserts for the ATLANTE 2 cup are made from
                    Biolox® Delta® alumina, fitted with a factory-set titanium ring. This
                    allows the use of Ø32mm and Ø36mm heads, <strong>thus reducing the risk
                    of luxation</strong>. This type of ceramic is recognised for its
                    fracture-resistance properties, but also for its hardness, <strong>reducing
                    wear on the insert</strong> and ensuring its longevity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The setting of the titanium ring, with its internal groove, <strong>ensures
                    easy fitting using its gripper</strong>, and allows ideal positioning of the
                    implant. The titanium ring also <strong>facilitates extraction, if necessary</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event of impingement, the ring will be the first element in
                    contact with the neck, <strong>protecting the ceramic from any conflict</strong>.
