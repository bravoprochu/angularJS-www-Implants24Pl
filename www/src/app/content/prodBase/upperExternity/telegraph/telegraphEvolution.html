            <div class="md-headline">Dear Colleagues,</div>
            <p>
                After 8 years, 25,000 TELEGRAPH® nails have been implanted
                worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
                TELEGRAPH® was the first to propose the principle of screw self‑stability
                in a nail. This nail is the most commonly implanted in France and its
                principles were soon copied by all the major companies in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are all signs of success for both the technique and the quality of the
                implants and their instrumentation.

            <p>
                The TELEGRAPH® nail remains the least obstructive
                material available for anterograde nailing of the
                humerus, be it for proximal or diaphyseal fractures. This
                limited obstruction plus the straightness of the nail are
                the explanation for the absence of lesions at the level of
                the rotator cuffs.
            </p>
            <div class="md-subhead">Indications</div>
            <p>
                This nail has become relatively "must-have" for two
                or three fragment extra-articular fractures (more than
                60% of cases), particularly with the percutaneous
                technique.
            </p>
            <p>
                Articular valgus impacted fractures are a very standard
                indication and are operated on by means of an equally
                standard technique. Three or four fragment disimpacted,
                or even dislocated, fractures remain indications that need
                discussing in relation to the implantation of a shoulder
                prosthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new version of the screws, like the new definition of
                self-stability, make it possible to develop the product's
                use in complex indications.
            </p>
            <div class="md-subhead">A scientific environment</div>
            <p>
                It is rare for a technique to have so rapidly provoked
                such a high level of scientific interest. At present, we
                can count a very high number of communications
                and publications. They originate from both the design
                centre and other centres.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four doctoral theses have been written on the subject.
                Three publications in particular are currently in press:
                one on the short TELEGRAPH® at four years, one on the
                long, and finally one that will soon propose a simpler and
                more reproducible classification system for fractures of
                the proximal humerus. This system is called AST.
            </p>
            <p>
                These studies were made possible in particular thanks to
                the participation of FH ORTHOPEDICS' André Hermann
                evaluation centre.

            <p>
                Today, new screws are proposed for proximal locking of the TELEGRAPH®.
                These screws retain their low obstruction qualities, making possible
                osteosynthesis of complex fractures, but have been strengthened in
                their central volume bore and in terms of the material from which they
                are made. These new screws have greater resistance to torsion and
                flexion than previous versions. No fractures have been reported with
                these screws.

            <p>
                In previous versions, the stability of the proximal screws within the nail,
                which is responsible for preventing swaying and migration into the
                openings, was damaged. This modification to the self-stability qualities,
                in addition to the relative weakness of the previous screws, broadly
                explains the disappointing results reported by certain teams on the
                subject of complex fractures. These new TM30 screws, with the latest
                versions of the self-stability system in the nail, guarantee total absence
                of movement of the screws and thus perfect stability of the assemblies.

                This is the technique currently used in more than 50 % of cases. Percutaneous
                implantation is particularly simple with 2 and 3 fragment extra-articular
                fractures.

            <p>
                One of the first evolutions in this nail was to propose an oblong distal opening
                for dynamic locking. This has become almost systematic in our practice. It
                makes it possible to compress the fracture site and thus avoid any risk of
                migration and rupture of the proximal screws.

                One of its particularities is its small diameter (7 mm for the smallest model)
                and its assisted original distal locking. This locking can here also (and should
                in our opinion) be dynamic.
