                    Displace the upper end of the humerus downwards and to the

                    4 retractors are required to expose the glenoid cavity:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            one retractor in front;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            one retractor below at 6 o'clock;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            one retractor to the rear at 8 o'clock (pushing back the
                            humerus protected by the metaphyseal rasp);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a deltoid retractor protecting the anterior fibres of the
                            deltoid.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    The capsule and the degenerated rim are resected anteriorly and
                    inferiorly to 8 o'clock.<br />
                    Where space in the shoulder is very limited, circumferential
                    resection of the capsule and rim is sometimes necessary.
