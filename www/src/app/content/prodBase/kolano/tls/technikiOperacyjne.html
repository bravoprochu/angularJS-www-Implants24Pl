    <p>A lateral view X-ray of the knee in extension enables the physician
to evaluate the distance between the desired fixation points. The
length of the intra articular path of the transplant is then determinated.
Accordingly, the total length of the transplant corresponds
to this measurement plus 10 mm for insertion into the femur and
15 mm for insertion into the tibia.</p>
</section>
<section>
<md-subheader class="md-primary">Positioning of the patient</md-subheader>
<p>Set up the X-RAY before disinfecting the patient to avoid any manipulation
of the sterile barrier during the surgical procedure. <strong>(Fig. 1)</strong>
The patient is in back decubitus, leg pending, knee at 90°.
It is now possible to control preoperatively each step of the procedure
under X-RAY.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">Graft harvesting</md-subheader>    
<p><strong>Oblique incision (Fig. 2a-b)</strong><p>
    <p>The semi-tendinosus (ST) is the primary autograft source for use
with the TLS system. An open-style tendon
stripper is included in the standard TLS instrument
set.<br>
In most cases the transplant used is the semi-
tendinosous (ST) but the gracilis can be
used to extend the graft to the length required
in case of ST harvesting troubles. <strong>(Fig. 2c)</strong></p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">Preparing the graft using the TLS workstation</md-subheader> 
<p>Select the graft’s length according to the height of the patient
using the graft length table. Place the posts on the workstation
accordingly. For graft Length higher than 60mm when using the T
table please add a table extension titanium piece available in the
PCL kit. This will ensure adequate graft size preparation. <strong>(Fig. 3)</strong></p>
<p>A 4 strand loop is formed on the workstation <strong>(Fig. 4)</strong>. According to
reference papers graft diameter should be no smaller than 8mm
to reduce revision rates.</p>
<p>This usually results in a construct with both loose ends near the
same post. Please respect the picture below.</p>
<image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(02)}}"></image-big>
<p>The first graft-formation suture is placed to secure the loose ends
to the main strands on the thicker part of the graft (Tibia part), this
will simulate the anatomy. Please respect the picture below.</p>
<image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(03)}}"></image-big>
<p>The 4 strands are joined together by a minimum of 3 cross stitches
at both ends of the graft. 2-3 sutures are placed in the open end
and 1-2 sutures are placed in the closed end.</p>
 <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(04)}}"></image-big>  
 <p>Sutures placed at 10 & 15mm can be used to control arthroscopically
the transplant penetration into the tibia and the femoral
sockets respectively or simply use the suture marker.</p>
<p>Next, the posts are removed from the sizer and the tapes are pulled
through the ends of the graft loops. The ends of the tapes are
evened prior to placement on the tensioner.</p>

  <md-subheader class="md-primary">Preconditioning of the graft (Fig.5)</md-subheader>
  <p>While securing the graft in the tensioner, and before placing the
graft under tension, make sure the movable tape clamp is snug up
against the stop button on the crossbar. Then:<br>
• Secure the tapes in the tensioner clamps<br>
• Turn the screw at the end of the tensioner until it is hand tight
and resistance is noted.<br>
• Push the tensioning lever down to a fully seated position and begin
recording the time under this amount of tension for 1 minute.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">Graft diameter</md-subheader>   
<p>Determine the graft diameter at each end of the graft by using
the graft diameter gauge included in the standard instrument set.
Select the retrograde reamers accordingly. <strong>(Fig. 6)</strong></p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">Arthroscopic step</md-subheader>     
 <p>Create antero-lateral and antero-medial portals for optic and instrument
tracts, close to the patella and as high as possible.
Joint preparation is standard, however careful cleaning of the
notch is recommended.<br>
A postero medial arthoscopic view can be used.
The universal guide provided with the instrumentation makes
possible outside-to-inside targeting for both the tibia and the
femur.  </p>
</section>
<section>
 <md-subheader class="md-primary">Outside-in tibia targeting</md-subheader>   
 <p>With the knee at 90°, move forward all the posterior vascular
structures.<br>
Insert only the PCL tibial hook to carefully clean the retro spinal
surface by using the tip of the tibial guide hook under X-RAY
control and/or an optical postero-medial portal.</p>
<p>Set the PCL guide to 60° in the sagittal plan and 20° in the frontal
plane. <strong>(Fig. 7)</strong>/<p>
<p>Notice that a scale engraved on the aimer's sleeve of the guide
gives the length of the future tunnel to check sufficient tunnel
length. For the tibia it should be at least 45mm otherwise use a
20mm screw (40mm minimum tunnel length). <strong>(Fig. 7)</strong></p>
<p>Place the hook on the posterior 1/3 of the retrospinal surface. XRAY
is required. <strong>(Fig. 8)</strong><br>
Use the 2.4mm guide pin to target the exact placement of the
tunnel.</p>

  <md-subheader class="md-primary">Reaming the tibia</md-subheader>             
    <p>With the tibial hook as a protection, overdrill the 2.4mm guide pin
with a 4.5 reamer always with both X-RAY control and arthroscopy.
<strong>(Fig. 9)</strong><br>
Maintain the 4.5mm drill, take out & flip the pin 2.4 guide pin then
introduce again the guide pin In the 4.5mm drill to get the atraumatic
end of the pin in contact with posterior soft tissues.
Take out the tibial hook and the 4.5mm drill.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">Tapping the tibia</md-subheader>    
 <p> Use the 2.4mm guide pin to keep alignment accurate.
The entry to the tibia tunnel is tapped on 15 or 20 mm in length
according to the screw selected (20 or 25mm length).<br>
Use the graduated marks on the tapping sleeve to control introduction.
<strong>(Fig. 10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not tap to agressivly.</strong></p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">Retrograde reaming of the tibia socket</md-subheader> 
 <p>The retrograde reamer inserted over the 2.4mm guide pin in the
frontal plane. Use X-RAY controls.<br>
The tibial socket is formed to a depth of 15mm which corresponds
to bringing the distal end of the reamer shaft to the level of the
bony aperture. <strong>(Fig. 11)</strong><br>
The retrograde reamer is then removed with the wings in the
same position as when it was inserted.<br>
Clean the entrance of the socket by using a tilted vaporization
electrode to facilitate the graft penetration.   </p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">Outside-in femur targeting</md-subheader>      
<p>Use the native PCL fibers to target the placement of the 2.4mm
guide pin in the original PCL footprint. <strong>(Fig. 12a)</strong>
Set the PCL aimer at 110°.<br>
PCL hook must be positioned in the center of the antero lateral
footprint.<br>
Intra-articular aperture can be selected and marked with an awl
(option in the TLS instrument set) via a medial joint line portal.
<strong>(Fig. 12b)</strong></p>
<p>This creates a pilote hole.</p>
<p>PCL guide must be 45° in the frontal plan and 20° anterior in the
sagittal plan to reach a minimum of 35mm tunnel length. <strong>(Fig. 12c)</strong><br>
Notice that a scale engraved on the sleeve of the guide gives the
length of the future tunnel to check sufficient tunnel length.</p>
<p>Drill the guide pin then maintain it with a grasper inside the joint.</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">Retrograde reaming of the femoral socket</md-subheader> 
<p>Guided on a pin, the retrograde reamer is inserted in the frontal
plan under arthroscopy control.<br>
The femoral socket is formed to a depth of 10mm which corresponds
to bringing the laser mark end of the reamer shaft to the
level of the bony aperture. <strong>(Fig. 15a)</strong><br>
The retrograde reamer is then removed with the wings in the
same position as when it was inserted.<br>
Clean the entrance of the socket.</p>
<p><strong>Cannula set up</strong></p>
<p>Guided on a pin, the cannula on femur and tibia are inserted in into
the previously tapped tunnels thanks to a cannula driver. <strong>(Fig. 15b)</strong>
The pins are then removed.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: insert the cannula until it is stable but, not more
than 15 or 20mm otherwise it will overtap.<br>
If the bone is weak, DO NOT USE the CANNULA and use the cannula stop piece only.</strong></p>
