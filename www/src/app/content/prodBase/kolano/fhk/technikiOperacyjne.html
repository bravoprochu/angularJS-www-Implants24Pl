        <p>The installation of a total prosthesis of the knee requires four essential elements to be adhered to:<br> • Correct alignment of the mechanical axis of the lower limb (Hip Knee Ankle angle at 180°);<br> • The stability of articulation achieved
            by careful verification of ligament tensions in flexion and in extension;<br> • A good level of freedom in functional range of movement<br> • Restoration of the level of the articular interline.</p>
        <p>Reliable instrumentation should enable this outcome to be achieved in the majority of cases. This depends on the implementation of orthogonal cuts on the frontal plane in relation to the mechanical axis of the femur and the tibia, and on the creation
            of satisfactory ligament balancing in extension and flexion.</p>

        <p><strong> must consist of:</strong> • front and profile X-rays with monopodal support;<br> • an axial image of the two knee joints, with the knee bent at 30°;<br> • a frontal image in stress on the healthy compartment to assess the degree of bone
            wear in the concavity and the reducibility proportion of the deformation associated with this wear. One can also assess the relative proportions of the deviation due to the actual morphological deformation and to the ligament retraction;<br>            • a goniometry under loading enabling the assessment of the overall mechanical axis of the lower membrane, as well as the angle formed by the diaphyseal axes of the femur and of the tibia with this mechanical axis.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">INSTALLATION AND APPROACH</md-subheader>
        <p>The intervention is generally performed with a mechanical tourniquet, but the choice will depend upon operating practices and upon the existence of any circulatory contraindications. Installation on a table laying down should enable easy movement
            from full extension to full, stable flexion of the knee.</p>
        <p>The approaches will depend upon each individual surgeon, but the instrumentation enables all the known variants to be used.<br> The small size of the instruments enables an approach to be used in minimally invasive surgery.<br> In the case of
            significant valgus deformity, another approach may be selected.</p>
        <p><strong>Although the technique was designed to begin with the
tibial cut, the instrumentation enables either a tibial cut or
a femoral cut to be performed first. While this order is of
little significance for arthrosis indications with little or no
deformity, although this should not prevent certain stages of
validation or verification, it is preferable to perform the tibial
cut first in cases of significant deformities and it is highly
recommended to do so in the case of the implantation of a
posterior stabilised prosthesis.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>It should also be specified that the instrumentation is
designed in order to achieve either an anterior or a posterior
reference.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In this case:<br>
• The posterior cut presents the same thickness as the size
of the implant;<br>
• The distal cut (except for a per-operative decision to the
contrary) is similar to the posterior cut.<br>
In consequence, the spaces allowed for in flexion and in
extension are equivalent, and equal to the thickness of the
implants that will be installed. The ligament tension will
automatically be correct, so long as it was correct before the
cuts.</strong></p>
