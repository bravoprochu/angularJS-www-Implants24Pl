        <p>The installation of a total prosthesis of the knee requires four essential elements to be adhered to:<br> • Correct alignment of the mechanical axis of the lower limb (Hip Knee Ankle angle at 180°);<br> • The stability of articulation achieved
            by careful verification of ligament tensions in flexion and in extension;<br> • A good level of freedom in functional range of movement<br> • Restoration of the level of the articular interline.</p>
        <p>Reliable instrumentation should enable this outcome to be achieved in the majority of cases. This depends on the implementation of orthogonal cuts on the frontal plane in relation to the mechanical axis of the femur and the tibia, and on the creation
            of satisfactory ligament balancing in extension and flexion.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">INSTALLATION AND APPROACH</md-subheader>
        <p>The intervention is generally performed with a mechanical tourniquet, but the choice will depend upon operating practices and upon the existence of any circulatory contraindications. Installation on a table laying down should enable easy movement
            from full extension to full, stable flexion of the knee.</p>
        <p>The approaches will depend upon each individual surgeon, but the instrumentation enables all the known variants to be used.<br> The small size of the instruments enables an approach to be used in minimally invasive surgery.<br> In the case of
            significant valgus deformity, another approach may be selected.</p>
        <p><strong>Although the technique was designed to begin with the
tibial cut, the instrumentation enables either a tibial cut or
a femoral cut to be performed first. While this order is of
little significance for arthrosis indications with little or no
deformity, although this should not prevent certain stages of
validation or verification, it is preferable to perform the tibial
cut first in cases of significant deformities and it is highly
recommended to do so in the case of the implantation of a
posterior stabilised prosthesis.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>It should also be specified that the instrumentation is
designed in order to achieve either an anterior or a posterior
reference.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In this case:<br>
• The posterior cut presents the same thickness as the size
of the implant;<br>
• The distal cut (except for a per-operative decision to the
contrary) is similar to the posterior cut.<br>
In consequence, the spaces allowed for in flexion and in
extension are equivalent, and equal to the thickness of the
implants that will be installed. The ligament tension will
automatically be correct, so long as it was correct before the
cuts.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Location of the medullary canal</strong></p>
        <p> The entry hole of the alignment is located at the tibial insertion of the ACL. In fact this should be more or less lateralised according to the status of the mechanical axis and curve of the tibia, the ideal being to determine this precisely on
            the preoperative X-ray.</p>
        <p><strong>Preoperative location of the precise entry point enables
avoidance of axial errors that would lead to an oblique
cut</strong>(either in the frontal plane or in the sagittal plane). A preliminary hole is made with a square point, then drilling to a diameter of 8 mm <strong>(Fig. 1)</strong>. The 8 mm diameter intramedullary stem is put in place <strong>(Fig. 2 & 3)</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>• Intramedull ary ali gnment</strong></p>
        <p>The tibial guide is placed on the centromedullary stem. This consists of an upper frame terminating in two points intended to penetrate the tibia bone, and a proximal extramedullary stem on which the cutting guide slides <strong>(Fig. 4)</strong>.</p>
        <p>The points of the frame are lowered as far as possible and inserted in two stages with a hammer into the anterior intercondylar area of the tibial PE insert: the stem of the alignment is carefully positioned at the centre of the pin. This position
            should bring the proximal stem in line with the internal third of the anterior tibial tuberosity. The rotation of the entire guide is then locked by the impaction of the second point.
            <br> • Extra medullar y ali gnment An extramedullary alignment is also possible (using the same assembly, but without the intramedullary stem), as well as the combined use of both types of alignment.<br> In any case, the extramedullary stem
            must be parallel to the axis of the tibia in both planes, to ensure the orthogonality of the cut <strong>(Fig. 5 & 6)</strong>.</p>

        <p>The probe, marked at 10 mm, is placed on the cutting guide on the clean side and the assembly lowered until it enters into contact with the medial part of the tibia <strong>(Fig. 7)</strong>. A control feeler slid into the opening of the cut will
            enable verification of the quantity of bone resected. The marked side “2” of the probe can also be used to perform a measurement of the amount of compartment used. In this case the cut will be made 2 mm under the cup.<br> The cut made will
            be orthogonal with the axis of the tibia, but this will not, a priori, indicate the thickness of insert to be used.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Validation of the level of the tibial cut</md-subheader>
        <p>If the verification of the cut shows an insufficient or excessive resection of bone, it is possible to raise or lower the cutting guide as the operator wishes, according to the graduations of the guide (in 2 mm steps). Two parallel pins are put
            in place at the level of the carved out holes “0”, then the alignment guide is delicately removed, having untightened the locking screw, carefully avoiding any movement involving force that could move the pins and the guide. The guide is moved
            as close as possible to the bone surface and a pin placed in the most lateral hole in order to stabilise the cutting guide.</p>

        <p>The cut is then made with an oscillating saw with a blade of thickness 1.27 mm, taking care, if the decision has been made to conserve it, to preserve the insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament [PCL] (especially if this cut is larger than
            10 mm), and at the same time protecting the medial and lateral capsular ligament planes <strong>(Fig. 8)</strong>.<br> The cutting block is provided to produce a cut that is orthogonal with the tibial axis in both planes.<br> The lateral pin
            is removed as well as the cutting guide.</p>

        <p>At this stage one can validate the flexion space using the 10 mm spacer mounted on the handle of the external alignment stem: this must be strictly parallel to the tibia (or better still, to the axis of the fibula which can be viewed using the
            other extramedullary stem joining the centre of the tibial PE insert to the external malleolus) <strong>(Fig. 9a)</strong>.<br> The size of the tibia can also be evaluated by positioning tibial Trial.
            <br> The size of the base must in general be immediately inferior, equal to or immediately superior to that of the femoral component.</p>

            <br> In the first place we begin by locating the position of the pilot hole using a square awl. The same care with location must be taken as in the tibial phase in order to avoid piercing the femur too far forward or backwards and causing
            errors in assessment of the size and positioning of the implants.<br> The hole is drilled with a diameter of 8 <strong>(Fig. 11)</strong>, with the maximum depth possible.<br> The centromedullary stem is put in place, and the removable handle

        <p>The positioning index of the posterior pallet is locked on the line “0” (in this case, the posterior cut will correspond to the prosthetic thickness of 8 mm).<br> In the case where an extension has been measured with a different value (greater
            or less than 18 mm), this index may be positioned on the line “+2” or “-2” in order to carry out the corresponding posterior cut. The assembly is applied to the bone cut, and the posterior pallets placed in contact with the posterior condyles

        <p><strong>Sizing</strong></p>
        <p>Femoral trials will be able to refine this information, especially with indication of the mediolateral dimensions. Finally it is the actual measurement of the size that that will provide the most reliable indication.<br> The assembly of the sizer
            enables the option of performing a femoral rotation to be taken into account. 2 rotation blocks of 3° are available (one left and one right); this will be fixed onto the measurer. If the operator prefers not to include rotation, 1 block of
            0° is supplied. The block selected will also be used on the 5 in 1 femoral cutting guide.<br> The sizer is installed, and the knee bent at 90° flexion <strong>(Fig. 21)</strong>. The use of the feeler slid into the opening corresponding to
            the selected size, will enable visualisation of the exit of the saw blade at the top of the trochlea, and thus ensure the correct choice of size.<br> When a posterior pre-cut is necessary, either in order to increase the flexion space or because
            the measurer has indicated a value between 2 sizes, this must be performed through openings in the posterior second cut guide which represents a cut thickness of 1.5 mm <strong>(Fig. 22)</strong>. In the case of a second cut associated with
            the size measurement, the inferior size is the one that will be selected.</p>

        <p>The monobloc cutting guide of the appropiate size is assembled with the valgus reference trial and adjusted to the determined angle by selecting the side being operated upon.<br> The assembly is slid onto the centromedullary stem.<br> The posterior
            sliders must come into close contact with the two posterior condyles, whereas its distal part must rest on at least one of the distal condyles. This position will be maintained by an assistant while the assembly is fixed to the femur using
            4 long lateral pins <strong>(Fig. 23)</strong>.<br> Once the fixation has been completed, the intramedullary stem will be removed, as will the reference trial rod.</p>
        <p>As all the cut openings are now clear, the femoral cuts will be performed in the order that best suits the surgeon <strong>(Fig. 24)</strong>. One essential point must be made: retain the distal cut as the last cut in order to maintain maximum
            stability for the assembly for as long as possible.<br> The cuts should be continued until the complete detachment of the bone blocks.<br> The removal of the fixing pins and cutting guide can then be performed.<br> The internal part of the

        <p>The axes are checked by placing a pin of 3.2 mm diameter in the femoral trial component and the external alignment stems in the shaft for the trial base <strong>(Fig. 25 and 26)</strong>. When the final positioning of the parts has been completed,
            the Trial base is fixed using short anterior nails <strong>(Fig. 27a)</strong>, and the anchorage studs for the femoral part are drilled with a drill with stop <strong>(Fig. 28).</strong></p>

        <p><strong>• Mobile bearing</strong></p>
        <p>The tibial trial base for the mobile bearing is introduced into the optimum anterioposterior location, and for the mediolateral and its rotation evaluated in relation to the standard anatomical reference points (internal third of the anterior
            tibial tuberosity). It is then locked off by a short nail which allows the possibility of self-positioning in rotation in relation to the femur, which can be achieved by a few flexion/ extension movements and knee joint reduced <strong>(Fig. 27b)</strong>.</p>
        <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(25)}}"></image-big>
        <p><strong>• Femoral component</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Drilling of plugs and preparation of the trochlea (5 in 1 technique)</strong></p>
        <p>The centring of the femoral component is checked, and the stud holes made using the drill with stop <strong>(Fig. 28)</strong>.
            <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(26)}}"></image-big>
            <p>If the 5 in 1 technique was used, the trochlea must be prepared with a specific chisel introduced into the orifice provided for this purpose and driven in with a hammer <strong>(Fig. 29)</strong>.</p>

            <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(28)}}"></image-big>
            <p><strong>Preparation of the tibial stem</strong></p>
            <p>Preparation of the tibial stem is performed by placing the perforation guide on the Trial base and by impacting the perforator of the corresponding size up to the end stop (there is a perforator for two sizes of base) <strong>(Fig. 31)</strong>.<br>                According to the operator’s choice, the perforator enables the recovery of a bone core (which will seal off the entry hole of the femoral alignment) or compaction of the trabecular network <strong>(Fig. 32)</strong>.</p>
            <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(29)}}"></image-big>

        <p><strong>1. First proceed with the installation of the tibial base.</strong></p>
        <p>If the cemented version was chosen, it will be prudent to wait until the cement has totally set. If it is necessary to use tibial stem, these should be mounted on the final implant with the aid of specific instruments: tightening support and 10
            mm flat key <strong>(Fig. 37a and 37b)</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>2. The second phase relates to the femoral implant (with or without cement) (Fig. 40).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>3. The polyethylene insert will then be installed and locked off.</strong></p>
        <p>The tibia will be dislocated forwards using a retractor to enable correct placement of the polyethylene insert. Its installation is performed by an oblique front to back and top to bottom movement to enable the posterior rims to engage properly
            in the throat of the base. Clip contact is achieved with an oblique blow applied with the specific impactor and patella if appropriate <strong>(Fig. 39a)</strong>.</p>
