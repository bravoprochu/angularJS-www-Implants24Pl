        <p>The installation of a total prosthesis of the knee requires four essential elements to be adhered to:<br> • Correct alignment of the mechanical axis of the lower limb (Hip Knee Ankle angle at 180°);<br> • The stability of articulation achieved
            by careful verification of ligament tensions in flexion and in extension;<br> • A good level of freedom in functional range of movement<br> • Restoration of the level of the articular interline.</p>
        <p>Reliable instrumentation should enable this outcome to be achieved in the majority of cases. This depends on the implementation of orthogonal cuts on the frontal plane in relation to the mechanical axis of the femur and the tibia, and on the creation
            of satisfactory ligament balancing in extension and flexion.</p>

        <p><strong> must consist of:</strong> • front and profile X-rays with monopodal support;<br> • an axial image of the two knee joints, with the knee bent at 30°;<br> • a frontal image in stress on the healthy compartment to assess the degree of bone
            wear in the concavity and the reducibility proportion of the deformation associated with this wear. One can also assess the relative proportions of the deviation due to the actual morphological deformation and to the ligament retraction;<br>            • a goniometry under loading enabling the assessment of the overall mechanical axis of the lower membrane, as well as the angle formed by the diaphyseal axes of the femur and of the tibia with this mechanical axis.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">INSTALLATION AND APPROACH</md-subheader>
        <p>The intervention is generally performed with a mechanical tourniquet, but the choice will depend upon operating practices and upon the existence of any circulatory contraindications. Installation on a table laying down should enable easy movement
            from full extension to full, stable flexion of the knee.</p>
        <p>The approaches will depend upon each individual surgeon, but the instrumentation enables all the known variants to be used.<br> The small size of the instruments enables an approach to be used in minimally invasive surgery.<br> In the case of
            significant valgus deformity, another approach may be selected.</p>
        <p><strong>Although the technique was designed to begin with the
tibial cut, the instrumentation enables either a tibial cut or
a femoral cut to be performed first. While this order is of
little significance for arthrosis indications with little or no
deformity, although this should not prevent certain stages of
validation or verification, it is preferable to perform the tibial
cut first in cases of significant deformities and it is highly
recommended to do so in the case of the implantation of a
posterior stabilised prosthesis.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>It should also be specified that the instrumentation is
designed in order to achieve either an anterior or a posterior
reference.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In this case:<br>
• The posterior cut presents the same thickness as the size
of the implant;<br>
• The distal cut (except for a per-operative decision to the
contrary) is similar to the posterior cut.<br>
In consequence, the spaces allowed for in flexion and in
extension are equivalent, and equal to the thickness of the
implants that will be installed. The ligament tension will
automatically be correct, so long as it was correct before the
cuts.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Location of the medullary canal</strong></p>
        <p> The entry hole of the alignment is located at the tibial insertion of the ACL. In fact this should be more or less lateralised according to the status of the mechanical axis and curve of the tibia, the ideal being to determine this precisely on
            the preoperative X-ray.</p>
        <p><strong>Preoperative location of the precise entry point enables
avoidance of axial errors that would lead to an oblique
cut</strong>(either in the frontal plane or in the sagittal plane). A preliminary hole is made with a square point, then drilling to a diameter of 8 mm <strong>(Fig. 1)</strong>. The 8 mm diameter intramedullary stem is put in place <strong>(Fig. 2 & 3)</strong>.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Positioning of the tibial cutting guide</md-subheader>
        <p><strong>• Intramedull ary ali gnment</strong></p>
        <p>The tibial guide is placed on the centromedullary stem. This consists of an upper frame terminating in two points intended to penetrate the tibia bone, and a proximal extramedullary stem on which the cutting guide slides <strong>(Fig. 4)</strong>.</p>
        <p>The points of the frame are lowered as far as possible and inserted in two stages with a hammer into the anterior intercondylar area of the tibial PE insert: the stem of the alignment is carefully positioned at the centre of the pin. This position
            should bring the proximal stem in line with the internal third of the anterior tibial tuberosity. The rotation of the entire guide is then locked by the impaction of the second point.
            <br> • Extra medullar y ali gnment An extramedullary alignment is also possible (using the same assembly, but without the intramedullary stem), as well as the combined use of both types of alignment.<br> In any case, the extramedullary stem
            must be parallel to the axis of the tibia in both planes, to ensure the orthogonality of the cut <strong>(Fig. 5 & 6)</strong>.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Determination of the level of cut</md-subheader>
        <p>The probe, marked at 10 mm, is placed on the cutting guide on the clean side and the assembly lowered until it enters into contact with the medial part of the tibia <strong>(Fig. 7)</strong>. A control feeler slid into the opening of the cut will
            enable verification of the quantity of bone resected. The marked side “2” of the probe can also be used to perform a measurement of the amount of compartment used. In this case the cut will be made 2 mm under the cup.<br> The cut made will
            be orthogonal with the axis of the tibia, but this will not, a priori, indicate the thickness of insert to be used.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Validation of the level of the tibial cut</md-subheader>
        <p>If the verification of the cut shows an insufficient or excessive resection of bone, it is possible to raise or lower the cutting guide as the operator wishes, according to the graduations of the guide (in 2 mm steps). Two parallel pins are put
            in place at the level of the carved out holes “0”, then the alignment guide is delicately removed, having untightened the locking screw, carefully avoiding any movement involving force that could move the pins and the guide. The guide is moved
            as close as possible to the bone surface and a pin placed in the most lateral hole in order to stabilise the cutting guide.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Tibial cut</md-subheader>
        <p>The cut is then made with an oscillating saw with a blade of thickness 1.27 mm, taking care, if the decision has been made to conserve it, to preserve the insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament [PCL] (especially if this cut is larger than
            10 mm), and at the same time protecting the medial and lateral capsular ligament planes <strong>(Fig. 8)</strong>.<br> The cutting block is provided to produce a cut that is orthogonal with the tibial axis in both planes.<br> The lateral pin
            is removed as well as the cutting guide.</p>

        <md-subheader class="md-primary">Validation of the flexion space</md-subheader>
        <p>At this stage one can validate the flexion space using the 10 mm spacer mounted on the handle of the external alignment stem: this must be strictly parallel to the tibia (or better still, to the axis of the fibula which can be viewed using the
            other extramedullary stem joining the centre of the tibial PE insert to the external malleolus) <strong>(Fig. 9a)</strong>.<br> The size of the tibia can also be evaluated by positioning tibial Trial.
            <br> The size of the base must in general be immediately inferior, equal to or immediately superior to that of the femoral component.</p>

        <p><strong>Centromedullary Preparation</strong></p>
        <p>The intercondylar notch is cleaned of any osteophytes <strong>(Fig. 10)</strong>, as is the external part of the condyles.<br> The posterior cruciate ligament/PCL is retained or sacrificed, depending on the type of prosthesis selected.<br> The
            intercondylar point of entry must be located facing and within the medullary canal, a few millimetres above the notch.
            <br> In the first place we begin by locating the position of the pilot hole using a square awl. The same care with location must be taken as in the tibial phase in order to avoid piercing the femur too far forward or backwards and causing
            errors in assessment of the size and positioning of the implants.<br> The hole is drilled with a diameter of 8 <strong>(Fig. 11)</strong>, with the maximum depth possible.<br> The centromedullary stem is put in place, and the removable handle
            is removed<br></p>
