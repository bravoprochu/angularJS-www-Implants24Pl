            The subscapularis muscle is moved slightly upwards to close the
            rotator interval and cover the head of the humerus.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is repaired by musculotendinous suturing to allow external
            rotation of at least 30° to 40° from the body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transosseous stitches are used at the anterior edge of the cut section
            of the humerus if the subscapularis has been freed subperiosteally
            for shoulders set in internal rotation, to allow external rotation of
            30° or 40°.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transosseous fixation is used on the anchor points of the osteotomy
            of the lesser tuberosity to control external rotation as well as
            possible.
