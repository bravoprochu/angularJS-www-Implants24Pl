            Displace the upper end of the humerus downwards and to the rear.
        </p>
        <p>
            4 retractors are required to expose the glenoid cavity:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    one retractor in front;
                </li>
                <li>
                    one retractor below at 6 o'clock;
                </li>
                <li>
                    one retractor to the rear at 8 o'clock (pushing back the humerus protected by the metaphyseal rasp);
                </li>
                <li>
                    a deltoid retractor protecting the anterior fibres of the deltoid.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The capsule and the degenerated rim are resected anteriorly and inferiorly to 8 o'clock.<br /> Where space in the shoulder is very limited, circumferential resection of the capsule and rim is sometimes necessary.
