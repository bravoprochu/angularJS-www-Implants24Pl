            The deltopectoral incision is made from the clavicle to the
            superior border of the pectoralis major, along the deltopectoral
            groove, lateral to the coracoid.
        </p>
        <p>The cephalic vein is retracted away.</p>

            Find the position of the musculocutaneous nerve with the
            finger, before putting a retractor under the coracobrachialis
            muscle.
        </p>

        <p>
            The position of the axillary nerve must be identified before
            sectioning the subscapularis muscle.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ligate the anterior circumflex vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Identify the rotator interval.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subscapular incision can be made in three ways:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    by sectioning the subscapularis muscle at the
                    musculotendinous junction and sectioning the articular capsule
                    at the same point;
                </li>
                <li>
                    if there is limited preoperative external rotation, by
                    detaching the subscapularis tendon subperiosteally starting
                    from the bicipital groove (identified by the long head of the
                    biceps at the superior border of the pectoralis major);
                </li>
                <li>
                    by osteotomy of the lesser tuberosity to reduce the risk of
                    secondary atrophy of the subscapularis.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In pathological conditions of the long head of the biceps:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    either a tenodesis is performed in the bicipital groove;
                </li>
                <li>
                    or a tenotomy.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(5)"></image-big>
        <p>
            Dislocate the head of the humerus in abduction and external
            rotation with retropulsion of the arm.
        </p>
        <image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(6)"></image-big>
        <p>
            Dislocation is only possible if the anterior-inferior capsule and
            the coracohumeral ligament have been sectioned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Osteophytes on the anatomical neck of the humerus are resected
            using bone forceps.
