            The length of the diaphyseal reamer allows the humeral stem to
            be aligned along the diaphyseal axis of the humerus and the risk of
            varus/valgus malpositioning to be reduced.

        <p>Perform diaphyseal reaming manually using increasing sizes of reamer (Ø 8, 10, 12, 14) until there is a sensation of reaming into the cortex.</p>

            The entry point for the square-point awl is at the junction
            between the summit of the humeral head cartilage and the
            greater tuberosity, about 1 cm posteriorly and medially to the
            bicipital groove.<br />
            If the cortical bone is thick the Ø6 diaphyseal bit (ref. 261 010) is
            recommended.

    <md-subheader class="md-primary">USE OF CUTTING GUIDES</md-subheader>
    <p>
        Assemble the cutting guide <strong>(ref. 261 052)</strong> with its support
        <strong>(ref. 261 011)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having fixed the axis of the guide, gradually externally rotate the
        arm until the forearm is in line with the screwed retroversion shaft
        <strong>(ref. 261 053)</strong> producing the angle chosen (0°, 10°, 20°, 30°,
        40°).<br />
        20° of retroversion is recommended for an anatomical prosthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
        The guide can be used on the right or left side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Put the humeral cutting guide <strong>(ref. 261 052)</strong> onto the diaphyseal
        reamer. The top of the cut starts systematically at the summit of the
        head of the humerus, at the junction between the humeral head
        cartilage and the greater tuberosity.
    </p>
    <p>The 135° angle is fixed.</p>
    <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(10)}}"></image-big>
    <p>
        When the depth of cut and degree of retroversion have been
        defined, fix the humeral cutting block (ref. 261 012) with
        a maximum of 4 pins <strong>(ref. 261 056)</strong> in the metaphysis; the
        diaphyseal reamer is then removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cut the head of the humerus using an oscillating saw along the
        groove in the humeral cutting block with a fixed angle of 135°
        and the selected retroversion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The diameter and thickness of the articular head is measured
        with the humeral head template.<br />
        Remove any osteophytes before measuring.
    </p>
    <i>Humeral head template</i>
    Ø40, 44, 46 <strong>ref. 261 041</strong><br />
    Ø48, 50, 54 <strong>ref. 261 042</strong>
    <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(11)}}"></image-big>
    <p>
        Reproduce the retroversion by aligning the retroversion
        shaft <strong>(ref. 261 053)</strong>, attached to the metaphyseal rasp handle
        <strong>(ref. 261 848)</strong>, and the forearm. It is identical to that produced on
        the cutting guide.
    </p>
    <p>
        The metaphysis is progressively prepared manually using
        increasing sizes of trial metaphyseal rasps.
        <i>Trial rasps: </i><br />
        Ø 8 ref. 261 044<br />
        Ø10 ref. 261 045<br />
        Ø12 ref. 261 046<br />
        Ø14 ref. 261 047<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        The orientation of the metaphyseal ridges of the rasp compacts
        the spongy bone and provides optimal stability for the implant.

        <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(12)}}"></image-big>
    <p>
        The trial humeral head should completely cover the bone surface
        of the cut humerus: a centred trial humeral head is used if the
        trial humeral stem is centred (Fig.1).<br />
        <i>Centred humeral heads (CHH)</i>- ref. from 261 026 to 261 040
    </p>
    <p>
        An off-centred trial humeral head should be preferred if the
        trial humeral stem is , in order to cover the cut bone as much as
        possible (Fig.2).<br />
        By marking the reference position of the trial off-centred head
        on the bone with an electric scalpel the definitive humeral head
        can be similarly positioned.<br />
        <i>Off-centred humeral heads (OCHH) </i>- ref. from 261 015 to 261 025
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the diameter and thickness of the humeral head have
        been chosen, check to see that the subscapularis can be repaired
        under tension (ER 30°).
    </p>
        <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(13)}}"></image-big>
    <p>
        There are 3 positions where the trial head of
        the humerus may completely cover the cut
        bone of the humerus.
    </p>
    <p>
        However the top of the humeral head must be
        approximately 5 mm higher than the summit
        of the greater tuberosity.
