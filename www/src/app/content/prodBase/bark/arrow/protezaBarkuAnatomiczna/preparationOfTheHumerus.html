        <p>The entry point for the square-point awl is at the junction between the summit of the humeral head cartilage and the greater tuberosity, about 1 cm posteriorly and medially to the bicipital groove.<br> If the cortical bone is thick the Ø6 diaphyseal
            bit <strong>(ref. 261 010)</strong> is recommended.

        <p>The length of the diaphyseal reamer allows the humeral stem to be aligned along the diaphyseal axis of the humerus and the risk of varus/valgus malpositioning to be reduced.<br>
            <strong> handle: ref. 261 054  </strong></p>
        <p>Perform diaphyseal reaming manually using increasing sizes of reamer (Ø 8, 10, 12, 14) until there is a sensation of reaming into the cortex.<br>

        <ul>
            <li>Assemble the cutting guide (ref. 261 052) with its support
                <strong>(ref. 261 011)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Having fixed the axis of the guide, gradually externally rotate the arm until the forearm is in line with the screwed retroversion shaft
                <strong>(ref. 261 053) </strong> the angle chosen (0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, 40°). 20° of retroversion is recommended for an anatomical prosthesis.
            </li>
            <li>The guide can be used on the right or left side.</li>
            <li>Put the humeral cutting guide <strong>(ref. 261 052)</strong> onto the diaphyseal reamer. The top of the cut starts systematically at the summit of the head of the humerus, at the junction between the humeral head cartilage and the greater
                tuberosity.
            </li>
            <li>The 135° angle is fixed.</li>
        </ul>
        <image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(11)"></image-big>

        <ul>
            <li>When the depth of cut and degree of retroversion have been defined, fix the humeral cutting block <strong>(ref. 261 012)</strong> with a maximum of 4 pins <strong>(ref. 261 056)</strong> in the metaphysis; the diaphyseal reamer is then removed.</li>
            <li>Cut the head of the humerus using an oscillating saw along the groove in the humeral cutting block with a fixed angle of 135° and the selected retroversion.</li>
            <li>The diameter and thickness of the articular head is measured with the humeral head template. Remove any osteophytes before measuring.
                <strong>Humeral head template Ø40, 44, 46 ref. 261 041
Humeral head template Ø48, 50, 54 ref. 261 042</strong></li>

        <image-big pic="vm.getImageByIdx(12)"></image-big>
        <ul>
            <li>Reproduce the retroversion by aligning the retroversion shaft <strong>(ref. 261 053)</strong>, attached to the metaphyseal rasp handle
                <strong>(ref. 261 848)</strong>, and the forearm. It is identical to that produced on the cutting guide.</li>
            <li>The metaphysis is progressively prepared manually using increasing sizes of trial metaphyseal rasps.
                <strong>Trial rasps: Ø 8 ref. 261 044<br>
Ø10 ref. 261 045<br>
Ø12 ref. 261 046<br>
Ø14 ref. 261 047</strong></li>
            <li>The orientation of the metaphyseal ridges of the rasp compacts the spongy bone and provides optimal stability for the implant.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The trial humeral head should completely cover the bone surface of the cut humerus: a centred trial humeral head is used if the trial humeral stem is centred <strong>(Fig.1)</strong>. Centred humeral heads (CHH)- <strong>ref. from 261 026 to 261 040</strong></li>
            <li>An off-centred trial humeral head should be preferred if the trial humeral stem is , in order to cover the cut bone as much as possible <strong>(Fig.2)</strong>. By marking the reference position of the trial off-centred head on the bone with
                an electric scalpel the definitive humeral head can be similarly positioned.<br> Off-centred humeral heads (OCHH) - <strong>ref. from 261 015 to 261 025</strong></li>
            <li>Once the diameter and thickness of the humeral head have been chosen, check to see that the subscapularis can be repaired under tension (ER 30°).</li>

        <ul>
            <li>There are <strong>3 positions</strong> where the trial head of the humerus may completely cover the cut bone of the humerus.<br> However the top of the humeral head must be approximately <strong>5 mm </strong> than the summit of the greater
                tuberosity.</li>
