                            Displace the upper end of the humerus downwards and to the
                            rear.

                            4 retractors are required to expose the glenoid cavity:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    one retractor in front;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    one retractor below at 6 o'clock;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    one retractor to the rear at 8 o'clock (pushing back the
                                    humerus protected by the metaphyseal rasp);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    a deltoid retractor protecting the anterior fibres of the
                                    deltoid.
                                </li>

                            The capsule and the degenerated rim are resected anteriorly and
                            inferiorly to 8 o'clock.<br />
                            Where space in the shoulder is very limited, circumferential
                            resection of the capsule and rim is sometimes necessary.

                            The central glenoid hole is marked with the square-point
                            awl using the most suitable glenoid template (44, 46, 48, 50
                            available).

                            The central glenoid hole is perforated with a Ø5 mm stopped
                            drill bit using the drilling guide which will be used later to drill
                            the glenoid holes.

                            Two openwork glenoid reamers (small and large) are used to
                            abrade the glenoid cavity while retaining the subchondral bone.<br />
                            Large reamer Ø36 ref. 261 075<br />
                            Small reamer Ø32 ref. 261 074<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These reamers can be used manually or be power-driven.
                            If powered, start the motor several millimetres from the bone to
                            avoid fracturing the glenoid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This burring can correct abnormal retroversion of the glenoid
                            cavity (by posterior wear) and create a concave surface which
                            will perfectly fit the convex base of the glenoid implant.

                        <p>
                            Excision of the bony edge is sometimes necessary using bone
                            forceps or the large reamer.

                            Deepen the central hole and insert the first fixing pin.
                            Drill the other glenoid holes (superior and inferior) and stabilise the
                            drilling guide with the other fixing pins.<br />
