        <p><strong>The success of a shoulder prosthesis
depends on its ability to reproduce normal
articular bone anatomy and re-establish
equilibrium between the soft tissues.
With its wide range of sizes of humeral
stems, centred and off-centred humeral
heads and glenoid implants, the ARROW
prosthesis can be adapted to any
morphology.<br>
Its well-designed shape and the
preservation of bone mass means that
the ARROW prosthesis is fixed stably,
guaranteeing an optimal life span.</strong></p>
