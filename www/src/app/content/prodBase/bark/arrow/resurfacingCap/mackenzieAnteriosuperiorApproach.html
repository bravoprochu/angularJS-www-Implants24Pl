<p>This approach is more lateral than the deltopectoral approach (in red).
</p>
<p>The cutaneous incision begins perpendicular to the
acromioclavicular joint, extends towards the anterior angle of the
acromion and extends laterally and inferiorly for 5 cm.
</p>
<p>The superficial surface of the deltoid is exposed. At the anterolateral
angle of the acromion, there is usually a raphe marking the line
between the middle and anterior bundles of the deltoid. This fascia
is divided in the direction of the muscle fibres. The inferior border of
the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa in general marks the limit which
should not be exceeded if any risk of damaging the terminal part of
the axillary nerve is to be avoided.
</p>
<p>The anterior bundle of the deltoid may be released subperiosteally
from the anterior border of the acromion to the anterior part of the
acromioclavicular joint, or even a little further medially towards
the clavicle. Be sure to maintain the continuity of the deltotrapezial
fascia. Similarly, the middle bundle of the deltoid may be released
for a few millimetres subperiosteally from the anterolateral border
of the acromion.
</p>
<p>The coracoacromial ligament is detached from the acromial mass
and an acromioplasty can be performed if necessary.
The anterior superior part of the head of the humerus is thus
exposed. The rotator interval must be located, and is more easily
identifiable internally, at the foot of the coracoid.
</p>
<p>The rotator interval is opened outwards, along the superior border
of the tendon of the subscapularis muscle as far as the point where
the tendon of the long head of the biceps leaves the bicipital
groove.
</p>
<p>The tendon of the subscapularis muscle will be cut with the anterior
capsule, 1 cm medial to its insertion on the lesser tuberosity as far
as the anterior circumflex pedicle.

<p>After dislocation of the head of the humerus, with the
arm in external rotation and slight abduction, it must be
completely exposed, so that the entire circumference of
the anatomical neck can be seen, including posteriorly.
The size of the implant to be fitted can be chosen using the
humeral head template.
It is essential to position it above and against the insertion
of the supraspinatus, 1 cm anterior to the insertion of the
infraspinatus.
</p>
<p><strong>Take into account particularly the
anteroposterior diameter; remove large
osteophytes as you externally rotate using a
medium osteotome.</strong></p>

<p> The two directional guide rods (inclination: 135°/retroversion: 20°)
are reference indicators for angles to adjust and position the implant.</p>
<image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(11)}}"></image-big
<p><strong>Inclination rod:</strong><br>
To be aligned with the humerus. The vertical corresponds to
a cervico-diaphyseal angle of 135°. </p>
<p><strong>Retroversion rod:</strong><br>
Aligned with the forearm, it corresponds to retroversion
of the head of the humerus of 20° (the retroversion can be
greater than 20°).</p>
<p>The periphery of the template must perfectly match the
anatomical neck.</p>
