    <p>The cutaneous incision starts from the clavicle and follows the deltopectoral groove vertically, level with the coracoid
        process (in green).
    </p>
    <p> Once the cutaneous incision has been made, the groove is located by the cephalic vein, which should be left on the deltoid
        side.
    </p>
    <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(5)}}"></image-big <p>After locating the lateral border of the short head of the biceps, the axillary clavipectoral fascia is
    incised and the subscapularis exposed. The axillary nerve is located with a finger.
    </p>
    <p> Retractors are inserted to retract:<br> 1. the deltoid laterally<br> 2. the short head of the biceps medially.
    </p>
    <image-big src="{{vm.getImageUrl(6)}}"></image-big <p>When the sheath of the biceps on the anterior surface of the metaphysis of the humerus is located, the
    long head of the biceps is sometimes found to be pathological and a tenodesis may be necessary if the tendon is damaged.
    </p>
    <p>By following the long head of the biceps the rotator interval can be found and opened and the superior border of the
        subscapularis
    </p>
    <p>After ligating the anterior circumflex vessels, the subscapularis tendon is sectioned and marked with threads.
    </p>
    <p>If necessary, the superior border of the pectoralis major tendon can be incised for 2 to 3 cm.
