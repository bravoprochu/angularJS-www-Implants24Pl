            The trial head is impacted onto the humerus. This trial is to verify that the implant will be in
            really good contact with the bone. The trial cap must fit perfectly.

            - Correct muscle tension can be checked with a trial reduction. At this point, the size of the
            head can be changed (with consequent further reaming).<br>
            - The pin must be sited where the epiphyseal bone is best preserved and most dense.<br>
            - Once the orientation choice has been made, mark the head circumference using pen or
            diathermy.

                A scalpel cut aligned with the laser line can be used to mark the
                definitive position of the studs.
