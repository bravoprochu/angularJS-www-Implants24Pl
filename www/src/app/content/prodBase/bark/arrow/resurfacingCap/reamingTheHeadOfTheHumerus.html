<p>Reaming is guided by the pin. It is performed
solely using the motor.</p>
<p>Begin using the reamer with a diameter next
above the predefined size.</p>

<p>Still guided by the pin, subsequent reaming must penetrate into the
head of the humerus as far as the anatomical neck, thus leaving a
1 to 2 mm bony step around the entire circumference of the head of
the humerus.</p>
<p>- Ream to the anatomical neck.<br>
- If there is no circumferential margin, ream the next size down.<br>
- Undertake final ablation of residual osteophytes.</p>
