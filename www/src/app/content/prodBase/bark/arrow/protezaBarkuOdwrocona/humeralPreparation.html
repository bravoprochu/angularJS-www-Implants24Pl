            The entry point for the square-point awl preparing for the
            introduction of the diaphyseal reamer is on the summit of the head
            of the humerus, about 1 cm medially and posterior to the bicipital
            groove.
        </p>
        Reamers:<br />
        Ø 8 ref. 261 048<br />
        Ø10 ref. 261 049<br />
        Ø12 ref. 261 050<br />

        <p>
            If the cortical bone is thick the Ø6 diaphyseal bit <strong>(ref. 261 010)</strong> is
            recommended.

            Assemble the cutting guide <strong>(ref. 261 052)</strong> with its support
            <strong>(ref. 261 011)</strong>.<br />
            Use the cutting guide for the superior-lateral route <strong>(ref. 261 057)</strong> fixed
            with 4 nails (maximum) <strong>(ref. 261 056)</strong>.<br />
            Put the support for the humeral cutting guide (ref. 261 052) onto
            the diaphyseal reamer to cut the bone at the anatomical neck at
            an angle of 135° retroverted by about 10° to 20°. The retroversion
            is given by the alignment of the forearm on the retroversion shaft
            <strong>(ref. 261 053)</strong>, fixed on the humeral cutting guide.

            The depth of resection of the head of the humerus is sufficiently
            deep if the medial part of the cut bone ends at the bottom of the
            glenoid cavity.<br />
            Carry out metaphyseal reaming with increasing sizes of rasps to
            produce the degree of retroversion previously decided.<br />
            The diaphyseal rasp chosen to serve as the trial humeral prosthesis
            is left in place to protect the upper end of the humerus during
            preparation of the glenoid.
