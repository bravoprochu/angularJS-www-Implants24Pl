            <strong>1. </strong>Fit the definitive glenosphere using the glenosphere support
            (ref. 261 101). Position the notch on the superior part of the
            glenosphere in line with the mark on the upper part of the metalback
            glenoid base.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>DO NOT IMPACT.</strong>

        <p>
            <strong>2. </strong>IMPACT the definitive glenosphere using the impaction endpiece <strong>(ref. 261 043)</strong> fitted to the handle <strong>(ref. 261 009).</strong>

        <p>
            The STD humeral insert is inclined at 155° and hollowed
            medially to avoid glenoid notching.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cup is held in place by impacting the morse cone and its
            under-surface locking into the shape of the humeral plate
            (complementary surfaces).

        <p>
            Cement the diaphyseal part of the humeral stem if the bone is
            osteoporotic or press-fit the humeral prosthesis without cement
            with shavings of metaphyseal cancellous bone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The STD humeral insert is impacted after the contours of the
            plate have been cleaned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Test the prosthesis in abduction, external and internal rotation;
            check that there is no internal conflict during adduction of the
            arm.
