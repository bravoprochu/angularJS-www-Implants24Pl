        <p>
            <strong>The short nail has three possible diameters:</strong>
            7 mm, 8 mm and 9 mm, and a single length of 15 cm.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>There are three techniques:</strong> percutaneous, standard and
            cup-and-ball.<br>
            The technique to be used must be chosen in relation to the
            increasing complexity of the fractures.

            Prior reduction is imperative, and this can be obtained either
            by external manoeuvres or percutaneously using a spatula or a
            pin (joystick manoeuvre, fig. 9).

            short pre-acromion incision makes it possible to introduce
            the blunt scissors until they come into contact with the head
            of the humerus.<br>
            The point of entry of the articular tip of the head can be
            identified using the fluoroscope with the awl square. This will
            trepan the head of the humerus.<br>
            The soft tissue retractor (<strong>ref. 236 844</strong>) makes it possible to approach
            the epiphysis so as to position the screws percutaneously.<br>
            The following times are those described in §1.4.<br>
            Distal locking is optional, though recommended (§1.5).

            and 4 articular fragments.

            The antero-external approach includes the incision and
            creation of the digastric trapezo-deltoid flap. The incision (fig. 9.1)
            measures 8 to 10 cm. It is centred by the antero-external angle
            of the acromion, 1/3 proximal, 2/3 distal, oriented in the same
            direction as the fibres of the deltoid.<br>
            The digastric trapezo-deltoid flap (fig. 10) is created by
            dissecting between the middle deltoid and the anterior
            deltoid with periosteal stripping of the acromion in the same
            axis. The digastric flap is tilted forwards, bringing with it the
            acromiocoracoid ligament. This approach is direct for the
            various fragments and, in particular, the tuberosities (fig. 11).

        <p>
            The fragments are reduced using a spatula, a Lambotte hook
            or external manoeuvres.
            More often than not, the head is pushed backwards. Knowing
            how to reduce it is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
            When reduction is difficult, it is possible to use a technique
            known as the " crucifixion technique " (fig. 12). This consists in
            pinning the head of the humerus into its anatomical position,
            against the glenoid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once reduction has been obtained, the nail can be installed in
            the usual manner (§1.2, §1.3, §1.4, §1.5).

            Difficult surgery. Not to be attempted without a certain amount

            The installation of the patient and
            antero-external approach are standard
            (§1.1 and 2.2).<br>
            The nail is positioned, along with
            its holder, without reduction of the
            fragments. It is screwed into place
            distally (fig. 13) using a static screw.<br>The nail-holder is dismantled.<br>
            The following stages consist in reducing the head of the
            humerus directly on to the proximal part of the nail. It is then
            screwed (fig. 14) on to the nail with two screws. The tuberosities,
            identified on the threads, are reduced and osteosutured to the
            head, to each other, to the nail and to the proximal part of the
            diaphysis. (fig. 15)
