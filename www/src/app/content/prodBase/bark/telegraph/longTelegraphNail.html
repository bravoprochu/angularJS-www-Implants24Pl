<md-subheader class="md-primary">LONG TELEGRAPH® NAIL</md-subheader>
<p><strong>The long nail has two diameters:</strong> 7 mm and 8 mm, and four
lengths : 21, 23, 25 and 27 cm.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">3.1 Installation of the nail and proximal
locking</md-subheader
<p>The installation and point of entry are standard.
Except under particular circumstances, the percutaneous
technique is used (§1.1, 1.2, 2.1).<br>
The 7 and 8 mm, rigid, graduated, manual reamers, used as far
as the distal humeral fragment, make it possible to determine
both diameter and length (fig. 16).<br>
The nail, mounted on its nail-holder (fig. 17), is introduced.
Passing the fracture site is typically easy. Setting the length
and proximal locking are standard (§1.3 and 1.4).</p>

 <md-subheader class="md-primary">3.2 Installation of the intermediate
positioner</md-subheader
<p>The aim is to rigidify the nail-holder for the distal guide.
The soft tissue retractor (intermediate obturator - ref. 253
676) used in the small guide (notched blue, ref. 253 679, short
guide) makes it possible to arrive, through the distal guide
opening, in contact with the humerus.<br>
The following stages consist in drilling the external cortex
with a grey drill bit with abutment (fig. 18, ref. 254 033). All
that then remains is to put the intermediate positioner (fig. 19,
ref. 253 675) into its notch, leaving the small guide in place.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">3.3 Distal locking</md-subheader
<p>Two coloured branches for the distal guide are available.
Yellow for the right side (<strong>ref. 253 674</strong>, right distal targeting
device) and blue for the left side (left distal targeting device,
<strong>ref. 253 673</strong>).<br>
They are joined using an M5 connective screw (<strong>ref. 253 681</strong>)
on the main beam, on the side of the band in the same colour,
at the level of the length mark of the nail (nail holder, <strong>ref. 253
671</strong>).</p>

<p>If there is a comminutive site, static assembly is recommended.
An additional distal cotter screw is installed, following the
previous steps.<br>
The fluoroscope view is no longer necessary, nor is drilling at
2.5 mm.</p>

<md-subheader class="md-primary">3.4 Remark: simplified technique</md-subheader
<p>With experience, it is possible to do the distal locking without
installing the intermediate positioner. The oblique view is
performed directly.<br>
The technique is identical, but without the stages described
in chapter 3.2.</p>
