        <p>
            The TELEGRAPH ® should not normally be removed in elderly patients.
            Two situations can nevertheless result in its removal being necessary:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>>> 1. The screws and/or nail are protruding and causing discomfort.</strong><br>
            In this situation, removal will be easy using material that is easy to
            find.<br>
            The installation is still the same (§1.1) with the fluoroscope to do the
            removal percutaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>>> 2. The patient is young.</strong><br>
            Removal may be difficult if the material is deeply embedded. The
            installation is the same.<br>
            The proximal extremity must be identified: using a metal pin with
            the fluoroscope makes identification possible. The nail-holder is then
            positioned on the nail. The guides make it possible to find the screws
            (fig. 22).

        <p>
            The nail holder is used to find the position of the screws. It should
            not be used to remove the nail. The nail must be removed with an
            extractor masselotte with screws on to the M5 connective screw. The
            masselotte and its axis are <u>optional</u>. If you plan to do removals, you
            should consider ordering them.
