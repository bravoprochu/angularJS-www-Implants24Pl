            The large and small guides (<strong>ref. 253 677</strong>, drill sleeve and
            <strong>ref. 253 678</strong>, screw-tap sleeve*) make packing possible at
            2.5 mm. The graduated drill bit gives the length (40 mm
            more often than not). The screws are positioned without
            screw-tapping at the proximal level using the bluehandled
            small fragment screwdriver (<strong>ref. 233 339</strong>).

            The two mediolateral frontal screws (fig. 6) are essential
            and stabilise the major tubercle and head of the
            humerus. The sagittal screw, which is optional, is placed
            with an extension of the ancillary system (fig. 7, proximal
            targeting device : 253 672, M5 connective screw : 253
            681). This screw is indicated for stabilising the minor
            tubercle or to perfect the osteosynthesis of the two
            frontal screws.

        <p>
            It is recommended that this be performed dynamically (most
            distal opening of the ancillary, fig. 8).<br>
            The soft-tissue retractor (obturator,<strong>ref. 236 844</strong>), introduced
            into the large guide, comes into contact percutaneously with
            the diaphyseal cortex. The following stages are:<br>
            - packing at 2.5 mm ;<br>
            - screw-tapping (ref. 233 341), obligatory at<br>
            this level (cortical bone);<br>
            - locking.
